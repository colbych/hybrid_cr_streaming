	Abstract = {The data on the inclusive flux of cosmic positrons and electrons (e++e�??) have been recently collected from GeV to tens of TeV energies by several experiments with unprecedented precision. In addition, the Fermi-LAT Collaboration has provided a new energy spectrum for the upper bounds on the e++e�?? dipole anisotropy.  This observable can bring information on the emission from local Galactic sources, notably measured with high precision at radio frequencies.  We develop a framework in which e�??  and e+ measured at Earth from GeV up to tens of TeV energies have a composite origin.    A dedicated analysis is deserved to Vela YZ and Cygnus Loop Supernova Remnants (SNRs), for which we consider two different models for the injection of e�??. We investigate the consistency of these models using the three physical observables: the radio flux from  Vela YZ and Cygnus Loop at all the available frequencies, the e++e�?? flux from five experiments from the GeV to tens of TeV energy,   the  e++e�?? dipole anisotropy upper limits from 50 GeV to about 1 TeV .  We find that the radio flux for these nearby SNRs strongly constraints the properties of the injection electron spectrum,   partially compatible with the looser constraints derived from the   e+��+��e�?? flux data. We also  perform a multi-wavelength multi-messenger analysis by fitting  simultaneously the radio flux on Vela YZ and Cygnus Loop and the e+��+��e�?? flux, and checking the outputs against the  e+��+��e�?? dipole anisotropy data.  Remarkably, we find a model which is compatible with all the e++e�?? flux data, the radio data for Vela YZ and Cygnus Loop, and with the anisotropy upper bounds.  We show the severe constraints imposed by the most recent data on the  e+��+��e�?? dipole anisotropy.},

	Abstract = {In this paper we note that the spectral intensities of antiprotons observed in Galactic cosmic rays in the energy range �?�1�??300 GeV by BESS, PAMELA, and AMS instruments display nearly the same spectral shape as that generated by primary cosmic rays through their interaction with matter in the interstellar medium, without any significant modifications. More importantly, a constant residence time of �?�2.3�����0.7 million years in the Galactic volume, independent of the energy of cosmic rays, matches the observed intensities. A small additional component of secondary antiprotons in the energy range below 10 GeV, generated in cocoon-like regions surrounding the cosmic-ray sources, seems to be present. We discuss this result in the context of observations of other secondary components such as positrons and boron, and the bounds on anisotropy of cosmic rays. In the nested leaky-box model the spectral intensities of antiprotons and positrons can be interpreted as secondary products of cosmic-ray interactions.},

	Abstract = {Collisionless shock nonstationarity arising from microscale physics influences shock structure and particle acceleration mechanisms. Nonstationarity has been difficult to quantify due to the small spatial and temporal scales. We use the closely spaced (subgyroscale), high-time-resolution measurements from one rapid crossing of Earth's quasiperpendicular bow shock by the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) spacecraft to compare competing nonstationarity processes. Using MMS's high-cadence kinetic plasma measurements, we show that the shock exhibits nonstationarity in the form of ripples.},

	Abstract = {Collisionless shocks in space plasma are known to be capable of accelerating ions to very high energies through diffusive shock acceleration (DSA). This process requires an injection of suprathermal ions, but the mechanisms producing such a suprathermal ion seed population are still not fully understood. We study acceleration of solar wind ions resulting from reflection off short large-amplitude magnetic structures (SLAMSs) in the quasi-parallel bow shock of Earth using in situ data from the four Cluster spacecraft. Nearly specularly reflected solar wind ions are observed just upstream of a SLAMS. The reflected ions are undergoing shock drift acceleration (SDA) and obtain energies higher than the solar wind energy upstream of the SLAMS. Our test particle simulations show that solar wind ions with lower energy are more likely to be reflected off the SLAMS, while high-energy ions pass through the SLAMS, which is consistent with the observations. The process of SDA at SLAMSs can provide an effective way of accelerating solar wind ions to suprathermal energies. Therefore, this could be a mechanism of ion injection into DSA in astrophysical plasmas.},

@article{crumley+19,
	Abstract = {We use fully kinetic particle-in-cell simulations with unprecedentedly large transverse box sizes to study particle acceleration in weakly magnetized mildly relativistic shocks travelling at a velocity {\ap} 0.75c and a Mach number of 15. We examine both subluminal (quasi-parallel) and superluminal (quasi-perpendicular) magnetic field orientations. We find that quasi-parallel shocks are mediated by a filamentary non-resonant (Bell) instability driven by returning ions, producing magnetic fluctuations on scales comparable to the ion gyroradius. In quasi-parallel shocks, both electrons and ions are accelerated into non-thermal power laws whose maximum energy grows linearly with time. The upstream heating of electrons is small, and the two species enter the shock front in rough thermal equilibrium. The shock's structure is complex; the current of returning non-thermal ions evacuates cavities in the upstream that form filaments of amplified magnetic fields once advected downstream. At late times, 10 per cent of the shock's energy goes into non-thermal protons and $\{${\gsim} $\}$10$\{$$\{$ per cent$\}$$\}$ into magnetic fields. We find that properly capturing the magnetic turbulence driven by the non-thermal ions is important for properly measuring the energy fraction of non-thermal electrons, {$\epsilon$}$_{e}$. We find {$\epsilon$}$_{e}$ {\tilde} 5 {\times} 10$^{-4}$ for quasi-parallel shocks with v = 0.75c, slightly larger than what was measured in simulations of non-relativistic shocks. In quasi-perpendicular shocks, no non-thermal power-law develops in ions or electrons. The ion acceleration efficiency in quasi-parallel shocks suggests that astrophysical objects that could host mildly relativistic quasi-parallel shocks - for example, the jets of active galactic nuclei or microquasars - may be important sources of cosmic rays and their secondaries, such as gamma-rays and neutrinos.},

	Abstract = {In solid targets irradiated by short pulse high intensity lasers, fast electrons have collision times longer than the laser pulse duration and mean free paths much larger than the radius of the laser spot. In these conditions, fast electron transport is dominated by electric and magnetic field. Although the fast electrons are collisionless, collisions of background electrons determine the ability of the background plasma to carry the return current which balances the fast electron current. Hence collisions are important even in this regime. A successful numerical simulation has to be able to model a plasma in which some electrons are collisionless and others are strongly collisional. An expansion of the electron distribution in spherical harmonics in momentum space is well suited to this, and we describe the formulation of the Vlasov--Fokker--Planck equation in terms of spherical harmonics and its solution in our KALOS code. We review the physics that must be modelled in a numerical simulation of fast electron transport and then describe KALOS.},

@article{cardillo+15,
	Abstract = {While from the energetic point of view supernova remnants are viable sources of Galactic cosmic rays (CRs), the issue of whether they can accelerate protons up to a few PeV remains unsolved. Here we discuss particle acceleration at the forward shock of supernovae, and discuss the possibility that the current of escaping particles may excite a non-resonant instability that in turn leads to the formation of resonant modes that confine particles close to the shock, thereby increasing the maximum energy. This mechanism is at work throughout the expansion of the supernova explosion, from the ejecta dominated (ED) phase to the Sedov�??Taylor (ST) phase. The transition from one stage to the other reflects in a break in the spectrum of injected particles. Because of their higher explosion rate, we focus our work on type II SNe expanding in the slow, dense wind, produced by the red super-giant progenitor stars. When the explosion occurs in such winds, the transition between the ED and the ST phase is likely to take place within a few tens of years. The highest energies are reached at even earlier times, when, however, a small fraction of the mass of ejecta has been processed. As a result, the spectrum of accelerated particles shows a break in the slope, at an energy that is the maximum energy (EM) achieved at the beginning of the ST phase. Above this characteristic energy, the spectrum becomes steeper but remains a power law rather than developing an exponential cutoff. An exponential cut is eventually present at much higher energies but it does not have a phenomenological relevance. We show that for parameters typical of type II supernovae, EM for protons can easily reach values in the PeV range, confirming that type II SNRs are the best candidate sources for CRs at the knee. From the point of view of implications of this scenario on the measured particle spectra, we have tried to fit KASCADE-Grande, ARGO -YBJ and YAC1-Tibet Array data with our model but we could not find any combination of the parameters that could explain all data sets. Indeed the recent measurement of the proton and helium spectra in the knee region, with the ARGO-YBJ and YAC1-Tibet Array, has made the situation very confused. These measurements suggest that the knee in the light component is at �?�650TeV, appreciably below the knee in the overall spectrum. On one hand this finding would resolve the problem of reaching very high energies in supernovae, but on the other it would open a critical issue in the transition region between Galactic and extragalactic CRs.},

	Abstract = {We have surveyed {\tilde}0.1-100 MeV nucleon$^{-1}$ O and
Fe fluence spectra during 46 isolated, large gradual SEP events observed
at ACE during solar cycles 23 and 24. Most SEP spectra are well
represented by the four-parameter Band function with a normalization
constant, low-energy spectral slope, high-energy spectral slope, and
break energy. The O and Fe spectral slopes are similar and most spectra
steepen above the break energy, probably due to common acceleration and
transport processes affecting different ion species. SEP spectra above
the break energies depend on the origin of the seed population; larger
contributions of suprathermal flare material result in higher Fe/O
ratios and flatter spectra at higher energies. SEP events with steeper O
spectra at low energies and higher break energies are associated with
slower coronal mass ejections (CMEs), while those associated with fast
($\gt$2000 km s$^{-1}$) CMEs and ground level enhancements
have harder or flatter spectra at low and high energies, and O break
energies between {\tilde}1 and 10 MeV nucleon$^{-1}$. The
latter events are enriched in $^{3}$He and higher-energy Fe, and
have Fe spectra that rollover at significantly lower energies compared
with O, probably because Fe ions with smaller Q/M ratios can escape from
the distant shock more easily than O ions with larger Q/M ratios. We
conclude that SEP spectral properties result from many complex and
competing effects, namely Q/M-dependent scattering, shock properties,
and the origin of the seed populations, all of which must be taken into
account to develop a comprehensive picture of CME-driven shock
acceleration of large gradual SEP events.},

species-independent and the spectra steepen with increasing energy; (2)
E $_{B}$ decreases systematically with decreasing Q/M scaling as
(Q/M)$^{ ?? }$; (3) {$\alpha$} varies between {\tilde}0.2-3

$_{1}$, and {$\gamma$} $_{b}$ and the Q/M dependence of E
$_{B}$ within an event and the {$\alpha$} values suggest that double
power-law SEP spectra occur due to diffusive acceleration by near-Sun
CME shocks rather than scattering in interplanetary turbulence. Using
{$\gamma$} $_{1}$, we infer that the average compression ratio for 33
near-Sun CME shocks is 2.49 {\plusmn} 0.08. In most events, the Q/M
dependence of E $_{B}$ is consistent with the equal diffusion
coefficient condition and the variability in {$\alpha$} is driven by
differences in the near-shock wave intensity spectra, which are flatter
than the Kolmogorov turbulence spectrum but weaker than the spectra for
extreme events. In contrast, in extreme events, enhanced wave power
enables faster CME shocks to accelerate impulsive suprathermal ions more
efficiently than ambient coronal ions.},

@article{reames15,
	Abstract = {We have spent 50 years in heated discussion over which populations of
solar energetic particles (SEPs) are accelerated at flares and which by
shock waves driven out from the Sun by coronal mass ejections (CMEs).
The association of the large ``gradual'' SEP events with shock
acceleration is supported by the extensive spatial distribution of SEPs
and by the delayed acceleration of the particles. Recent STEREO
observations have begun to show that the particle onset times correspond
to the observed time of arrival of the shock on the observer's magnetic
flux tube and that the SEP intensities are related to the local shock
speed. The relative abundances of the elements in these gradual events
are a measure of those in the ambient solar corona, differing from those
in the photosphere by a widely-observed function of the first ionization
potential (FIP) of the elements. SEP events we call ``impulsive'', the
traditional ``$^{3}$He-rich'' events with enhanced heavy-element
abundances, are associated with type III radio bursts, flares, and
narrow CMEs; they selectively populate flux tubes that thread a
localized source, and they are fit to new particle-in-cell models of
magnetic reconnection on open field lines as found in solar jets. These
models help explain the strong enhancements seen in heavy elements as a
power (of 2-8) in the mass-to-charge ratio A/Q throughout the periodic
table from He to Pb. A study of the temperature dependence of A/Q shows
that the source plasma in impulsive SEP events must lie in the range of
2-4 MK to explain the pattern of abundances. This is much lower than the
temperatures of $\gt$10 MK seen on closed loops in solar flares. Recent
studies of A/Q-dependent enhancements or suppressions from scattering
during transport show source plasma temperatures in gradual SEP events
to be 0.8-1.6 MK in 69 \% of the events, i.e. coronal plasma; 24 \% of the
events show reaccelerated impulsive-event material.},

	Abstract = {The origin of cosmic rays (CRs) has puzzled scientists since the
pioneering discovery by Victor Hess in 1912. In the last decade,
however, modern supercomputers have opened a new window on the processes
regulating astrophysical collisionless plasmas, allowing the study of CR
acceleration via first-principles kinetic simulations. At the same time,
a new-generation of X-ray and $\gamma$-ray telescopes has been
collecting evidence that Galactic CRs are accelerated in the blast waves
of supernova remnants (SNRs). I present state-of-the-art
particle-in-cells simulations of non-relativistic shocks, in which ion
and electron acceleration efficiency and magnetic field amplification
are studied in detail as a function of the shock parameters. I then
discuss the theoretical and observational counterparts of these
findings, comparing them with predictions of diffusive shock
acceleration theory and with multi-wavelength observations of young
SNRs. I especially outline some major open questions, such as the
possible causes of the steep CR spectra inferred from $\gamma$-ray
observations of SNRs and the origin of the knee in the Galactic CR
spectrum. Finally, I put such a theoretical understanding in relation
with CR propagation in the Galaxy in order to bridge the gap between
acceleration in sources and measurements of CRs at Earth.},

@article{liu+17,
	Abstract = {Several types of foreshock transients upstream of Earth's bow shock
possessing a tenuous, hot core have been observed and simulated. Because
of the low dynamic pressure in their cores, these phenomena can
significantly disturb the bow shock and the magnetosphere-ionosphere
system. Recent observations have also demonstrated that foreshock
transients can accelerate particles which, when transported earthward,
can affect space weather. Understanding the potential of foreshock
transients to accelerate particles can help us understand shock
acceleration at Earth and at other planetary and astrophysical systems.
To further investigate foreshock transients' potential for acceleration,
we conduct a statistical study of ion and electron energization in the
core of foreshock transients. We find that electron energies typically
increase there, evidently due to an internal acceleration process,
whereas, as expected, ion energies most often decrease to support
transient formation and expansion. Nevertheless, ion energy enhancements
can be seen in some events suggesting an internal ion acceleration
process as well. Formation conditions of foreshock transients are
related to weak solar wind magnetic field strength and fast solar wind
speed. Ion and electron energization are also positively correlated with
solar wind speed.},

	Abstract = {The interaction between galactic cosmic rays and Alfv{\~A}{\copy}n
waves in the interstellar medium is investi- gated. They may interact
adiabatically through magnetic mirror scattering or non-adiabatically
through gyration frequency resonance. The equations describing the
latter are derived. The growth rates for the waves are given, and the
Fokker-Planck equation for the diffusion of cosmic rays in velocity
space is derived. These two equations are applied to a model of the
cosmic rays consisting of a uniform tube of magnetic field with open
ends. An equation of spatial diffusion is derived in the limit of strong
wave- particle scattering, and this equation is compared with the
observed properties of the galactic cosmic rays to derive a mean free
path for scattering of about 10 pc. It is shown that when the
interstellar damping of the Alfv{\~A}{\copy}n waves is included, the
waves are probably marginally stable. Finally, a self- consistent model
is specified in which the sources of turbulence and cosmic rays are
given and the cosmic- ray densities are to be determined. This model is
solved in the crude approximation where all particles have effectively
the same energy and all waves the same wavelength. It is shown that the
cosmic rays can have an appreciable effect on their confinement to the
Galaxy. It is shown that if the inhomogeneous distribution of mass is
taken into account, the confinement of cosmic rays is determined
primarily by the low-density regions between the clouds. An attempt is
made to evaluate the efficiency of heating of cosmic rays, and it
appears that their energy changes very little during their galactic
confinement. However, because there is a non-linear relation between the
source and the cosmic-ray density, the observed energy spectrum does not
necessarily represent the emitted spectrum},

	Abstract = {We have developed an updated and expanded version of our parametric formulation to calculate the charge-changing and isotopic cross sections for reactions of energetic Z �?� 28 nuclei in hydrogen targets. The goal of this formulation is the calculation of the now-available measured cross sections, which include greater than 98% of all incoming Z �?� 3 in the Galactic cosmic rays, to an improved level of accuracy. Two important systematics greatly facilitate this parametric formulation. The first is related to the fact that the elemental cross sections into a particular Zf from a beam charge Zi can be well represented by an exponential function of the difference Zi - Zf. The second is related to the fact that the width of the individual mass distributions for a given fragment charge follow closely a Gaussian distribution centered on a value of the neutron excess that can be described in a systematic way. These two systematics alone provide the basis for predicting 75% of all of the measured cross sections. The energy dependence of the cross sections has also been completely revised using newer data at both higher and lower energies. These new cross sections are then used in a set of Galactic cosmic-ray propagation calculations. These calculations made using the leaky box model correctly predict the measured Li, Be, and B ratios and the measured isotopic ratios of those charges at �?�100 MeV nucleon-1 to the accuracy of the experimental data itself. They also correctly predict the recently measured energy dependence of the K-capture ratios 49Ti/49V and 51V/51Cr, assuming a solar modulation parameter �? = 300-400 MV at the time of measurement. The new cross sections also reduce significantly the differences between the path lengths required to simultaneously predict the measured cosmic-ray B/C and Z = 21-23/Fe ratios at �?�1 GeV nucleon-1. The new cross sections for B and Z = 21-23 nuclei production are �?�15% less at 10 GeV nucleon-1 than earlier formulations. This leads to a significantly smaller cosmic-ray escape length dependence on rigidity for Galactic propagation models than earlier calculations.},

	Abstract = {Supernova remnants (SNRs) are thought to be the primary sources of
Galactic cosmic rays (CRs). In the last few years, the wealth of
{$\gamma$}-ray data collected by GeV and TeV instruments has provided
important information about particle energization in these astrophysical
sources, allowing us to make progress in assessing their role as CR
accelerators. In particular, the spectrum of the {$\gamma$}-ray emission
detected by AGILE and Fermi-LAT from the two middle-aged SNRs W44 and IC
443, has been proposed as a proof of CR acceleration in SNRs. Here we
discuss the possibility that the radio and {$\gamma$}-ray spectra from W44
may be explained in terms of reacceleration and compression of Galactic
CRs. The recent measurement of the interstellar CR flux by Voyager 1 has
been instrumental for our work, in that the result of the reprocessing
of CRs by the shock in W44 depends on the CR spectrum at energies that
are precluded from terrestrial measurement owing to solar modulation. We
introduce both CR protons and helium nuclei in our calculations, and
secondary electrons produced in situ are compared with the flux of
Galactic CR electrons reprocessed by the slow shock of this SNR. We find
that the multiwavelength spectrum of W44 can be explained by
reaccelerated particles with no need of imposing any break on their
distribution, but just a high-energy cutoff at the maximum energy the
accelerator can provide. We also find that a model including both
reacceleration and a very small fraction of freshly accelerated
particles may be more satisfactory on physical grounds.},

found ``GeV-bright'' supernova remnants (SNRs) can be explained by a model
in which a shocked cloud and shock-accelerated cosmic rays (CRs) frozen
in it are simultaneously compressed by the supernova blast wave as a
result of formation of a radiative cloud shock. Simple reacceleration of
pre-existing CRs is generally sufficient to power the observed gamma-ray
emission through the decays of {$\pi$}$^{0}$-mesons produced in
hadronic interactions between high-energy protons (nuclei) and gas in
the compressed-cloud layer. This model provides a natural account of the
observed synchrotron radiation in SNRs W51C, W44, and IC 443 with flat
radio spectral index, which can be ascribed to a combination of
secondary and reaccelerated electrons and positrons.},

	Abstract = {We have surveyed $^{3}$He-rich solar energetic particle (SEP)
events over the period 1997 September-2003 April in order to
characterize abundances of heavy ions near 400 keV nucleon$^{-1}$.
The first part of the study focuses on 20 distinct SEP events that show
the previously observed pattern in which, relative to O, heavy ions
through Fe are enriched, with the enrichment increasing with mass. We
find that these enrichments are well correlated such that
$^{3}$He-rich SEP events with high Fe/C also show larger
enrichments in other heavy ions. Ultraheavy (UH; taken as 78-220 amu)
ions are routinely seen in these events with abundance enhancements
correlating with Fe/C but with even larger flare-to-flare variations. In
one event with unusually little interplanetary scattering, we are able
to estimate the time of heavy- and UH-ion injections at the Sun and find
them to be simultaneous. The second part of the study sums up many
impulsive-event time periods in order to construct a mass histogram of
UH nuclei; this histogram shows broad mass peaks similar to those in
compilations of solar system abundances. In this summed period, relative
to O, the average enhancement of heavy nuclei increases with mass with
values of \~{}7 for Fe, \~{}40 for mass 78-100 amu, \~{}120 for mass 125-150 amu,
and \~{}215 for 180-220 amu. The maximum UH enhancements seen in the
most-enriched events are at least a factor of 5 larger. The enhancements
are approximately proportional to the particle charge-to-mass ratio
raised to a power, as seen previously in large, shock-associated SEP
events.},

	Abstract = {First data from NASA's Interstellar Boundary EXplorer (IBEX) mission
show a striking ``ribbon'' feature of enhanced energetic neutral atom
(ENA) emission. The enhancement in flux is between 2 and 3 times greater
than adjacent regions of the sky. Yet the spectral index of ENAs appears
to be the same both inside and outside the ribbon. While the ribbon
itself was not predicted by any models of the heliospheric interface,
its geometry appears to be related to the predicted interstellar
magnetic field (ISMF) outside the heliopause (HP). In this Letter, we
examine a process of ENA emission from the outer heliosheath, based on a
source population of non-isotropic pick-up ions that themselves
originate as ENAs from inside the HP. We find that our simplistic
approach yields a ribbon of enhanced ENA fluxes as viewed from the inner
heliosphere with a spatial location and ENA flux similar to the IBEX
measurements, with the provision that the ions retain a partial shell
distribution long enough for the ions to be neutralized. As a corollary,
our idealized simulation of this mechanism suggests that ISMF is likely
oriented close to the center of the observed ribbon.},

	Abstract = {Measurements of the composition and spatial distribution of pick-up ions
inside the heliosphere are reviewed. The first interstellar \^{}4He\^{}+
pick-up ions were detected with the SULEICA instrument on the AMPTE
spacecraft near Earth's orbit. Most data on pick-up ions were taken in
the solar-wind and suprathermal energy range of SWICS on Ulysses while
the spacecraft cruised from 1.4 to 5.4 AU and explored the high-latitude
heliosphere and solar wind from the ecliptic to +/- 80\^{}{\deg}
heliolatitude. This includes the discovery of H\^{}+, \^{}4He\^{}++, \^{}3He\^{}+, N\^{}+,
O\^{}+, and Ne\^{}+ pick-up ions that originate from the interstellar neutral
gas penetrating the heliosphere. From their fluxes properties of the
interaction region between the heliosphere and the Local Interstellar
Cloud such as the limits on filtration and the strength of the
interstellar magnetic field have been revealed. Detailed analysis of the
velocity distributions of pick-up ions led to 1) the discovery of a new
distinct source, the so-called Inner Source, consisting of atoms
released from interstellar and interplanetary dust inside the
heliosphere, 2) the determination of pick-up ion transport parameters
such as the long mean free path for pitch-angle scattering of order 1
AU, and 3) detailed knowledge on the very preferential injection and
acceleration of pick-up ions during interplanetary energetic particle
events such as Co-rotating Interaction Regions and Coronal Mass
Ejections. SWICS measurements have fully confirmed the theory of Fisk,
Koslovsky, and Ramaty that pick-up ions derived from the interstellar
gas are the dominant source of the Anomalous Cosmic Rays; they are
pre-accelerated inside the heliosphere and re-accelerated at the
solar-wind Termination Shock according to Pesses, Eichler, and Jokipii.
The data indicate that the Inner Source of pick-up ions is largely
responsible for the occurence of C\^{}+ in the Anomalous Cosmic Rays. The
abundances of recently discovered Inner-Source Mg\^{}+ and Si\^{}+ are
solar-wind like and consistent with their abundances in the energetic
particles associated with Co-rotating Interaction Regions. Knowledge on
the injection and acceleration processes in Co-rotating Interaction
Regions is applied to discuss the current observational evidence for the
Interplanetary Focusing Cone of the interstellar neutral gas due to the
Sun's gravitational force. The 25-150 keV/amu suprathermal \^{}4He\^{}+
pick-up ion fluxes measured by CELIAS/STOF on board SOHO over 360\^{}{\deg}
of ecliptic longitude represent a `local' ionization and acceleration of
interstellar atoms at 1 AU or smaller heliocentric distances. Completing
the first limited data set of SULEICA/AMPTE on \^{}4He\^{}+ pick-up ions they
indicate a density enhancement in the Interplanetary Focusing Cone which
is confirmed by recent SWICS/ACE data. Clear evidence for signatures in
ecliptic longitude are found in the data on energetic neutral H fluxes
observed with the CELIAS/HSTOF sensor on board SOHO. These fluxes are
enhanced in the upstream and downstream directions of the interstellar
wind. Detection of energetic H atoms, which propagate unaffected by the
Heliospheric Magnetic Field, provided for the first time a diagnostic
tool for observations near Earth to analyze the structure in ecliptic
longitude of the interface region between the heliosphere and the Local
Interstellar Cloud.},

@article{zank+96,
	Abstract = {A new mechanism for the acceleration of pickup ions by repeated
reflections from the electrostatic cross shock potential of a
quasi-perpendicular shock is presented. The acceleration mechanism,
multiply reflected ion (MRI) acceleration, offers a resolution to the
issue of injecting pickup ions into an efficient particle energization
scheme, and the injection efficiency for pickup ions is found to be
inversely proportional to ion mass and proportional to charge. By
studying the particle energy gain in the motional electric field (where
a steady shock frame is assumed) the energized pickup ion spectrum can
be computed. Extremely hard power law spectra (E$^{-1.5}$, for
example) emerge from the upstream pickup ion distribution. The maximum
energy that a reflected pickup ion can gain is found to be proportional
to the square of the product of the Alfv{\'e}n speed and (r-1), where
r is the shock compression ratio. For solar wind conditions at either
interplanetary shocks or the termination shock the upper energy limit is
typically in excess of 0.5 MeV. It is suggested here that MRI
acceleration provides an efficient mechanism for injecting low-energy
pickup ions into a subsequent acceleration process such as diffusive
Fermi acceleration. Such a two-step acceleration scheme alleviates many
of the difficulties which plague ion energization models at
perpendicular shocks. The structure of a quasi-perpendicular shock
modified by shock reflection of pickup ions is discussed in general
terms.

By way of application we present a detailed study of the MRI
acceleration mechanism at the termination shock for a wide range of
parameters and discuss the implications for the anomalous cosmic ray
component. The acceleration of pickup ions by an interplanetary
traveling shock is also discussed, and the observations made by Ulysses
[Gloeckler et al., 1994] are addressed. The puzzling aspects of the
Gloeckler et al. [1994] observations appear to be explained quite
naturally by shock energization based on repeated pickup ion
reflections. Observational tests of MRI acceleration may be possible by
using pickup He$^{+}$ at either the terrestrial or Jovian bow
shock or by using cometary ions at a cometary bow shock.},

	Abstract = {Radio observations prove the existence of relativistic particles and
magnetic field associated with the intra-cluster-medium (ICM) through
the presence of extended synchrotron emission in the form of radio halos
and peripheral relics. This observational evidence has fundamental
implications on the physics of the ICM. Nonthermal components in galaxy
clusters are indeed unique probes of very energetic processes operating
within clusters that drain gravitational and electromagnetic energy into
cosmic rays (CRs) and magnetic fields. These components strongly affect
the (micro-)physical properties of the ICM, including viscosity and
electrical conductivities, and have also potential consequences on the
evolution of clusters themselves. The nature and properties of CRs in
galaxy clusters, including the origin of the observed radio emission on
cluster-scales, have triggered an active theoretical debate in the last
decade. Only recently we can start addressing some of the most important
questions in this field, thanks to recent observational advances, both
in the radio and at high energies. The properties of CRs and of cluster
nonthermal emissions depend on the dynamical state of the ICM, the
efficiency of particle acceleration mechanisms in the ICM and on the
dynamics of these CRs. In this paper, we discuss in some detail the
acceleration and transport of CRs in galaxy clusters and the most
relevant observational milestones that have provided important steps on
our understanding of this physics. Finally, looking forward to the
possibilities from new generations of observational tools, we focus on
what appear to be the most important prospects for the near future from
radio and high-energy observations.},

	Abstract = {We discuss new methods to integrate the cosmic ray (CR) evolution
equations coupled to magnetohydrodynamics on an unstructured moving
mesh, as realized in the massively parallel AREPO code for cosmological
simulations. We account for diffusive shock acceleration of CRs at
resolved shocks and at supernova remnants in the interstellar medium
(ISM) and follow the advective CR transport within the magnetized
plasma, as well as anisotropic diffusive transport of CRs along the
local magnetic field. CR losses are included in terms of Coulomb and
hadronic interactions with the thermal plasma. We demonstrate the
accuracy of our formalism for CR acceleration at shocks through
simulations of plane-parallel shock tubes that are compared to newly
derived exact solutions of the Riemann shock-tube problem with CR
acceleration. We find that the increased compressibility of the
post-shock plasma due to the produced CRs decreases the shock speed.
However, CR acceleration at spherically expanding blast waves does not
significantly break the self-similarity of the Sedov-Taylor solution;
the resulting modifications can be approximated by a suitably adjusted,
but constant adiabatic index. In first applications of the new CR
formalism to simulations of isolated galaxies and cosmic structure
formation, we find that CRs add an important pressure component to the
ISM that increases the vertical scaleheight of disc galaxies and thus
reduces the star formation rate. Strong external structure formation
shocks inject CRs into the gas, but the relative pressure of this
component decreases towards halo centres as adiabatic compression
favours the thermal over the CR pressure.},

	Abstract = {The role of cosmic rays generated by supernovae and young stars has very recently begun to receive significant attention in studies of galaxy formation and evolution due to the realization that cosmic rays can efficiently accelerate galactic winds. Microscopic cosmic-ray transport processes are fundamental for determining the efficiency of cosmic-ray wind driving. Previous studies modeled cosmic-ray transport either via a constant diffusion coefficient or via streaming proportional to the Alfv�n speed. However, in predominantly cold, neutral gas, cosmic rays can propagate faster than in the ionized medium, and the effective transport can be substantially larger; i.e., cosmic rays can decouple from the gas. We perform three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamical simulations of patches of galactic disks including the effects of cosmic rays. Our simulations include the decoupling of cosmic rays in the cold, neutral interstellar medium. We find that, compared to the ordinary diffusive cosmic-ray transport case, accounting for the decoupling leads to significantly different wind properties, such as the gas density and temperature, significantly broader spatial distribution of cosmic rays, and higher wind speed. These results have implications for X-ray, ? -ray, and radio emission, and for the magnetization and pollution of the circumgalactic medium by cosmic rays.},

	Abstract = {Galactic-scale winds are a generic feature of massive galaxies with high
star formation rates across a broad range of redshifts. Despite their
importance, a detailed physical understanding of what drives these mass
loaded global flows has remained elusive. In this paper, we explore the
dynamical impact of cosmic rays (CRs) by performing the first
three-dimensional, adaptive mesh refinement simulations of an isolated
starbursting galaxy that includes a basic model for the production,
dynamics and diffusion of galactic CRs. We find that including CRs
naturally leads to robust, massive, bipolar outflows from our
10$^{12}$ M$_{???}$ halo, with a mass loading factor
dot$\{$M$\}$/SFR = 0.3 for our fiducial run. Other reasonable parameter
choices led to mass loading factors above unity. The wind is multiphase
and is accelerated to velocities well in excess of the escape velocity.
We employ a two-fluid model for the thermal gas and relativistic CR
plasma and model a range of physics relevant to galaxy formation,
including radiative cooling, shocks, self-gravity, star formation,
supernovae feedback into both the thermal and CR gas and isotropic CR
diffusion. Injecting CRs into star-forming regions can provide
significant pressure support for the interstellar medium (ISM),
suppressing star formation and thickening the disc. We find that CR
diffusion plays a central role in driving superwinds, rapidly
transferring long-lived CRs from the highest density regions of the disc
to the ISM at large, where their pressure gradient can smoothly
accelerate the gas out of the disc.},

	Abstract = {We present a detailed analysis of the GeV gamma-ray emission toward the supernova remnant (SNR) G8.7--0.1 with the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on board the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. An investigation of the relationship between G8.7--0.1 and the TeV unidentified source HESS J1804--216 provides us with an important clue on diffusion process of cosmic rays if particle acceleration operates in the SNR. The GeV gamma-ray emission is extended with most of the emission in positional coincidence with the SNR G8.7--0.1 and a lesser part located outside the western boundary of G8.7--0.1. The region of the gamma-ray emission overlaps spatially connected molecular clouds, implying a physical connection for the gamma-ray structure. The total gamma-ray spectrum measured with LAT from 200 MeV-100 GeV can be described by a broken power-law function with a break of 2.4 $\pm$ 0.6 (stat) $\pm$ 1.2 (sys) GeV, and photon indices of 2.10 $\pm$ 0.06 (stat) $\pm$ 0.10 (sys) below the break and 2.70 $\pm$ 0.12 (stat) $\pm$ 0.14 (sys) above the break. Given the spatial association among the gamma rays, the radio emission of G8.7--0.1, and the molecular clouds, the decay of π0s produced by particles accelerated in the SNR and hitting the molecular clouds naturally explains the GeV gamma-ray spectrum. We also find that the GeV morphology is not well represented by the TeV emission from HESS J1804--216 and that the spectrum in the GeV band is not consistent with the extrapolation of the TeV gamma-ray spectrum. The spectral index of the TeV emission is consistent with the particle spectral index predicted by a theory that assumes energy-dependent diffusion of particles accelerated in an SNR. We discuss the possibility that the TeV spectrum originates from the interaction of particles accelerated in G8.7--0.1 with molecular clouds, and we constrain the diffusion coefficient of the particles.},

	Abstract = {We present the third Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) source catalog
(3FGL) of sources in the 100 MeV-300 GeV range. Based on the first
4 yr of science data from the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope mission,
it is the deepest yet in this energy range. Relative to the Second Fermi
LAT catalog, the 3FGL catalog incorporates twice as much data, as well
as a number of analysis improvements, including improved calibrations at
the event reconstruction level, an updated model for Galactic diffuse
{$\gamma$}-ray emission, a refined procedure for source detection, and
improved methods for associating LAT sources with potential counterparts
at other wavelengths. The 3FGL catalog includes 3033 sources above
4{$\sigma$}  significance, with source location regions, spectral
properties, and monthly light curves for each. Of these, 78 are flagged
as potentially being due to imperfections in the model for Galactic
diffuse emission. Twenty-five sources are modeled explicitly as
spatially extended, and overall 238 sources are considered as identified
based on angular extent or correlated variability (periodic or
otherwise) observed at other wavelengths. For 1010 sources we have not
found plausible counterparts at other wavelengths. More than 1100 of the
identified or associated sources are active galaxies of the blazar
class; several other classes of non-blazar active galaxies are also
represented in the 3FGL. Pulsars represent the largest Galactic source
class. From source counts of Galactic sources we estimate that the
contribution of unresolved sources to the Galactic diffuse emission is
{\tilde}3\% at 1 GeV.},

	Abstract = {We have performed 2D hybrid simulations of non-relativistic collisionless shocks in the presence of pre-existing energetic particles (``seeds''); such a study applies, for instance, to the re-acceleration of Galactic cosmic rays (CRs) in supernova remnant (SNR) shocks and solar wind energetic particles in heliospheric shocks. Energetic particles can be effectively reflected and accelerated regardless of shock inclination via a process that we call $\backslash$emph$\{$diffusive shock re-acceleration$\}$. We find that reaccelerated seeds can drive the streaming instability in the shock upstream and produce effective magnetic field amplification. This can eventually trigger the injection of thermal protons even at oblique shocks that ordinarily cannot inject thermal particles. We characterize the current in reflected seeds, finding that it tends to a universal value $J\simeq e n\_{cr} v\_{sh}$, where $e n\_{cr}$ is the seed charge density and $v\_{sh}$ is the shock velocity. When applying our results to SNRs, we find that the re-acceleration of Galactic CRs can excite the Bell instability to non-linear levels in less than $\sim 10$ yr, thereby providing a minimum level of magnetic field amplification for any SNR shock. Finally, we discuss the relevance of diffusive shock re-acceleration also for other environments, such as heliospheric shocks, Galactic superbubbles, and clusters of galaxies.},

	Abstract = {Hybrid codes, in which the ions are treated kinetically and the electrons are assumed to be a massless fluid, have been widely used in space physics over the past two decades. These codes are used to model phenomena on ion inertial and gyro-radius scales, which fall between longer scales obtained by magnetohydrodynamic simulations and shorter scales attainable by full particle simulations. In this tutorial, the assumptions and equations of the hybrid model are described along with some most commonly used numerical implementations. Modifications to include finite electron mass are also briefly discussed. Examples of results of two-dimensional hybrid simulations are used to illustrate the method, to indicate some of the tradeoffs that need to be addressed in a realistic calculation, and to demonstrate the utility of the technique for problems of contemporary interest. Some speculation about the future direction of space physics research using hybrid codes is also provided.},

	Abstract = {Magnetic reconnection in a plane current sheet is investigated in both two and three dimensions, using three different types of simulation codes, Hall MHD, hybrid (electron fluid, kinetic ions), and a new code called Hall-less hybrid. The latter code, which is similar to the hybrid code but has the Hall term removed, enables us to clarify the differences between kinetic ion and Hall MHD approaches. The major findings of this research are (1) Sweet-Parker regime of reconnection cannot be maintained and does not reach a steady state in a kinetic plasma for physically interesting parameter regimes. (2) Fast asymptotic reconnection rate of 0.15V$_{A0}$B$_{0}$ is obtained both in the hybrid and Hall-less hybrid simulations with outflow boundaries. V$_{A0}$ and B$_{0}$ are the Alfv{\'e}n velocity and magnetic field strength in the upstream region. This finding has two immediate implications. First, ion kinetics are sufficient to lead to fast reconnection even in the absence of the Hall term, and second, explanation of fast reconnection in terms of quadratic disperion of whistlers needs to be reconsidered, as whistlers are dispersionless in Hall-less hybrid limit. (3) Unlike in MHD, diffusion region is different in size that the region of localized resistivity. (4) While both Hall and hybrid codes show that reconnection is inherently asymmetric in three dimensions, there are differences in the nature of the asymmetry. In Hall MHD we show that the X-line grows in the direction of the electron drift, propagating as a (reconnection) wave because the current is carried by electrons, although the wave direction can change in the presence of a substantial ion flow. However, in the hybrid simulations here, as is the case for typical conditions at the magnetopause and magnetotail, ions carry the bulk of the current, and the observed asymmetry is found to be due to ion flow and not a wave motion unless the extent of finite resistivity in the third dimension is very thin, comparable to the current sheet thickness. Thus aside from scenarios where electrons are the dominant current carriers, such as very thin current sheets that are on electron scales, we do not expect the reconnection wave to form. This result is relevant to the magnetotail where dawn-dusk asymmetries are observed in the motions of auroral brightenings and surges, as well as in the statistical location of pressure decreases, flows, and magnetic signatures associated with the near-Earth neutral line and early plasmoids. We attribute the observed dawn-dusk asymmetries to ion flows. One interesting question left for future work is the possibility that reconnection waves may form in thin electron-scale current layers that are sometimes observed embedded within a thicker sheet in the magnetotail.},

A {$\delta$}f scheme is included to facilitate a reduced-noise study of systems in which only small departures from an initial distribution function are anticipated. The effects of rotation and shear are implemented through the shearing-sheet formalism with orbital advection. These algorithms are embedded within an architecture similar to that used in the popular astrophysical magnetohydrodynamics code Athena, one that is modular, well-documented, easy to use, and efficiently parallelized for use on thousands of processors.

	Abstract = {Cosmic ray (CR) currents through magnetized plasma drive strong instabilities producing amplification of the magnetic field. This amplification helps explain the CR energy spectrum as well as observations of supernova remnants and radio galaxy hotspots. Using magnetohydrodynamic simulations, we study the behaviour of the non-resonant hybrid (NRH) instability (also known as the Bell instability) in the case of CR currents perpendicular and parallel to the initial magnetic field. We demonstrate that extending simulations of the perpendicular case to 3D reveals a different character to the turbulence from that observed in 2D. Despite these differences, in 3D the perpendicular NRH instability still grows exponentially far into the non-linear regime with a similar growth rate to both the 2D perpendicular and 3D parallel situations. We introduce some simple analytical models to elucidate the physical behaviour, using them to demonstrate that the transition to the non-linear regime is governed by the growth of thermal pressure inside dense filaments at the edges of the expanding loops. We discuss our results in the context of supernova remnants and jets in radio galaxies. Our work shows that the NRH instability can amplify magnetic fields to many times their initial value in parallel and perpendicular shocks.},

	Abstract = {A new, much-improved model of the Galactic magnetic field (GMF) is presented. We use the WMAP7 Galactic synchrotron emission map and more than 40,000 extragalactic rotation measures to constrain the parameters of the GMF model, which is substantially generalized compared with earlier work to now include an out-of-plane component (as suggested by observations of external galaxies) and striated-random fields (motivated by theoretical considerations). The new model provides a greatly improved fit to observations. Consistent with our earlier analyses, the best-fit model has a disk field and an extended halo field. Our new analysis reveals the presence of a large, out-of-plane component of the GMF; as a result, the polarized synchrotron emission of our Galaxy seen by an edge-on observer is predicted to look intriguingly similar to what has been observed in external edge-on galaxies. We find evidence that the cosmic-ray electron density is significantly larger than given by GALPROP or else that there is a widespread striated component to the GMF.},

	Abstract = {We extend the description of the isotropic and anisotropic random component of the small-scale magnetic field within the existing magnetic field model of the Milky Way from Jansson {\amp} Farrar, by including random realizations of the small-scale component. Using a magnetic-field power spectrum with Gaussian random fields, the NE2001 model for the thermal electrons and the Galactic cosmic-ray electron distribution from the current GALPROP model we derive full-sky maps for the total and polarized synchrotron intensity as well as the Faraday rotation-measure distribution. While previous work assumed that small-scale fluctuations average out along the line-of-sight or which only computed ensemble averages of random fields, we show that these fluctuations need to be carefully taken into account. Comparing with observational data we obtain not only good agreement with 408 MHz total and WMAP7 22 GHz polarized intensity emission maps, but also an improved agreement with Galactic foreground rotation-measure maps and power spectra, whose amplitude and shape strongly depend on the parameters of the random field. We demonstrate that a correlation length of 0{\ap}22 pc (05 pc being a 5{$\sigma$} lower limit) is needed to match the slope of the observed power spectrum of Galactic foreground rotation-measure maps. Using multiple realizations allows us also to infer errors on individual observables. We find that previously-used amplitudes for random and anisotropic random magnetic field components need to be rescaled by factors of {\ap}0.3 and 0.6 to account for the new small-scale contributions. Our model predicts a rotation measure of -2.8{\plusmn}7.1 rad/m$^{2}$ and 04.4{\plusmn}11. rad/m$^{2}$ for the north and south Galactic poles respectively, in good agreement with observations. Applying our model to deflections of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays we infer a mean deflection of {\ap}3.5{\plusmn}1.1 degree for 60 EeV protons arriving from CenA.},

	Abstract = {The physics of charged-particle acceleration from near-thermal to much higher energies by collisionless shocks is investigated using large-scale self-consistent plasma simulations. The focus here is on acceleration at shocks that move normal to the average magnetic field. It is shown that a fraction of thermal protons incident on a perpendicular shock are readily accelerated to energies much higher than the ram energy of the incident plasma. This indicates that there is not an injection problem at perpendicular shocks. It is found that some (initially) thermal protons are reflected by the shock and move upstream along magnetic field lines that are multiply connected to other locations on the shock. This leads to efficient acceleration and results in a distribution function, averaged over a large spatial region downstream of the shock, having a high-energy tail that originates directly from the thermal population. It can be concluded from our results that perpendicular shocks are important sites of particle acceleration in a wide variety of astrophysical plasmas.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the physics of charged-particle acceleration at spherical shocks moving into a uniform plasma containing a turbulent magnetic field with a uniform mean. This has applications to particle acceleration at astrophysical shocks, most notably, to supernovae blast waves. We numerically integrate the equations of motion of a large number of test protons moving under the influence of electric and magnetic fields determined from a kinematically defined plasma flow associated with a radially propagating blast wave. Distribution functions are determined from the positions and velocities of the protons. The unshocked plasma contains a magnetic field with a uniform mean and an irregular component having a Kolmogorov-like power spectrum. The field inside the blast wave is determined from Maxwell{\rsquo}s equations. The angle between the average magnetic field and unit normal to the shock varies with position along its surface. It is quasi-perpendicular to the unit normal near the sphere{\rsquo}s equator, and quasi-parallel to it near the poles. We find that the highest intensities of particles, accelerated by the shock, are at the poles of the blast wave. The particles {\ldquo}collect{\rdquo} at the poles as they approximately adhere to magnetic field lines that move poleward from their initial encounter with the shock at the equator, as the shock expands. The field lines at the poles have been connected to the shock the longest. We also find that the highest-energy protons are initially accelerated near the equator or near the quasi-perpendicular portion of the shock, where the acceleration is more rapid.},

We also report 14 marginal associations and 245 flux upper limits. A mock catalog in which the positions of known remnants are scrambled in Galactic longitude allows us to determine an upper limit of 22\% on the number of GeV candidates falsely identified as SNRs. We have also developed a method to estimate spectral and spatial systematic errors arising from the diffuse interstellar emission model, a key component of all Galactic Fermi LAT analyses. By studying remnants uniformly in aggregate, we measure the GeV properties common to these objects and provide a crucial context for the detailed modeling of individual SNRs. Combining our GeV results with multiwavelength (MW) data, including radio, X-ray, and TeV, we demonstrate the need for improvements to previously sufficient, simple models describing the GeV and radio emission from these objects. We model the GeV and MW emission from SNRs in aggregate to constrain their maximal contribution to observed Galactic cosmic rays.},

	Abstract = {Context. Features in the spectra of primary cosmic rays (CRs) provide invaluable information on the propagation of these particles in the Galaxy. In the rigidity region around a few hundred GV, these features have been measured in the proton and helium spectra by the PAMELA experiment and later confirmed with a higher significance by AMS-02. We investigate the implications of these data sets for the scenario in which CRs propagate under the action of self-generated waves. <BR /> Aims: We show that the recent data on the spectrum of protons and helium nuclei as collected with AMS-02 and Voyager are in very good agreement with the predictions of a model in which the transport of Galactic CRs is regulated by self-generated waves. We also study the implications of the scenario for the boron-to-carbon ratio: although a good overall agreement is found, at high energy we find marginal support for a (quasi) energy independent contribution from the grammage, which we argue may come from the sources themselves. <BR /> Methods: The transport equation for both primary and secondary nuclei is solved together with an equation for the evolution of the self-generated waves and a background of pre-existing waves. The solution for this system of nonlinear equations is found with an iterative method elaborated by the same authors in a previous work on this topic. <BR /> Results: A break in the spectra of all nuclei is found at a rigidity of a few hundred GV, as a result of a transition from self-generated waves to pre-existing waves with a Kolmogorov power spectrum. Neither the slope of the diffusion coefficient, nor its normalization are free parameters. Moreover, at rigidities below a few GV, CRs are predicted to be advected with the self-generated waves at the local Alfv{\'e}n speed. This effect, predicted in our previous work, provides an excellent fit to the Voyager data on the proton and helium spectra at low energies, providing additional support to the model.},

	Abstract = {Star formation and supermassive black hole growth in galaxies appear to be self-limiting. The mechanisms for self-regulation are known as feedback. Cosmic rays, the relativistic particle component of interstellar and intergalactic plasma, are among the agents of feedback. Because cosmic rays are virtually collisionless in the plasma environments of interest, their interaction with the ambient medium is primarily mediated by large scale magnetic fields and kinetic scale plasma waves. Because kinetic scales are much smaller than global scales, this interaction is most conveniently described by fluid models. In this paper, I discuss the kinetic theory and the classical theory of cosmic ray hydrodynamics (CCRH) which follows from assuming cosmic rays interact only with self-excited waves. I generalize CCRH to generalized cosmic ray hydrodynamics, which accommodates interactions with extrinsic turbulence, present examples of cosmic ray feedback, and assess where progress is needed.},

	Abstract = {Solar wind is probably the best laboratory to study turbulence in astrophysical plasmas. In addition to the presence of magnetic field, the differences with neutral fluid isotropic turbulence are: (i) weakness of collisional dissipation and (ii) presence of several characteristic space and time scales. In this paper we discuss observational properties of solar wind turbulence in a large range from the MHD to the electron scales. At MHD scales, within the inertial range, turbulence cascade of magnetic fluctuations develops mostly in the plane perpendicular to the mean field, with the Kolmogorov scaling                                                                   {\$}k{\_}{\{}{\backslash}perp{\}}^{\{}-5/3{\}}{\$}               for the perpendicular cascade and                                                                   {\$}k{\_}{\{}{\backslash}|{\}}^{\{}-2{\}}{\$}               for the parallel one. Solar wind turbulence is compressible in nature: density fluctuations at MHD scales have the Kolmogorov spectrum. Velocity fluctuations do not follow magnetic field ones: their spectrum is a power-law with a ?3/2 spectral index. Probability distribution functions of different plasma parameters are not Gaussian, indicating presence of intermittency. At the moment there is no global model taking into account all these observed properties of the inertial range. At ion scales, turbulent spectra have a break, compressibility increases and the density fluctuation spectrum has a local flattening. Around ion scales, magnetic spectra are variable and ion instabilities occur as a function of the local plasma parameters. Between ion and electron scales, a small scale turbulent cascade seems to be established. It is characterized by a well defined power-law spectrum in magnetic and density fluctuations with a spectral index close to ?2.8. Approaching electron scales, the fluctuations are no more self-similar: an exponential cut-off is usually observed (for time intervals without quasi-parallel whistlers) indicating an onset of dissipation. The small scale inertial range between ion and electron scales and the electron dissipation range can be together described by                                                                   {\$}{\backslash}sim k{\_}{\{}{\backslash}perp{\}}^{\{}-{\backslash}alpha{\}}{\backslash}exp(-k{\_}{\{}{\backslash}perp{\}}{\backslash}ell{\_}{\{}d{\}}){\$}              , with $\alpha$?8/3 and the dissipation scale ?                              d               close to the electron Larmor radius ?                              d              ?$\rho$                              e              .

	Abstract = {Numerical simulations have become a major tool for understanding galaxy formation and evolution. Over the decades the field has made significant progress. It is now possible to simulate the formation of individual galaxies and galaxy populations from well defined initial conditions with realistic abundances and global properties. An essential component of the calculation is to correctly estimate the inflow to and outflow from forming galaxies since observations indicating low formation efficiency and strong circum-glactic presence of gas are persuasive. Energetic 'feedback' from massive stars and accreting super-massive black holes - generally unresolved in cosmological simulations - plays a major role for driving galactic outflows, which have been shown to regulate many aspects of galaxy evolution. A surprisingly large variety of plausible sub-resolution models succeeds in this exercise. They capture the essential characteristics of the problem, i.e. outflows regulating galactic gas flows, but their predictive power is limited. In this review we focus on one major challenge for galaxy formation theory: to understand the underlying physical processes that regulate the structure of the interstellar medium, star formation and the driving of galactic outflows. This requires accurate physical models and numerical simulations, which can precisely describe the multi-phase structure of the interstellar medium on the currently unresolved few hundred parsecs scales of large scale cosmological simulations. Such models ultimately require the full accounting for the dominant cooling and heating processes, the radiation and winds from massive stars and accreting black holes, an accurate treatment of supernova explosions as well as the non-thermal components of the interstellar medium like magnetic fields and cosmic rays.},

	Abstract = {Supernova (SN) explosions deposit prodigious energy and momentum in their  environments, with the former regulating multiphase thermal structure and  the latter regulating turbulence and star formation rates in the  interstellar medium (ISM). However, systematic studies quantifying the  impact of SNe in realistic inhomogeneous ISM conditions have been lacking.  Using three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations, we investigate the  dependence of radial momentum injection on both physical conditions  (considering a range of mean density n$_{0}$ = 0.1-100 cm$^{-3}$) and numerical parameters. Our inhomogeneous simulations adopt two-phase  background states that result from thermal instability in atomic gas.  Although the supernova remnant (SNR) morphology becomes highly complex for  inhomogeneous backgrounds, the radial momentum injection is remarkably  insensitive to environmental details. For our two-phase simulations,  the final momentum produced by a single SN is given by  2.8{\times}10$^{5}$ M$_{?}$ km s$^{-1}$  n$_{0}$$^{-0.17}$. This is only 5\% less than the momentum  injection for a homogeneous environment with the same mean density, and  only 30\% greater than the momentum at the time of shell formation. The  maximum mass in hot gas is also quite insensitive to environmental  inhomogeneity. Strong magnetic fields alter the hot gas mass at very  late times, but the momentum injection remains the same. Initial experiments  with multiple spatially correlated SNe show a momentum per event nearly as  large as single-SN cases. We also present a full numerical parameter study  to assess convergence requirements. For convergence in the momentum and  other quantities, we find that the numerical resolution {$\Delta$} and the  initial size of the SNR r$_{init}$ must satisfy {$\Delta$},  r$_{init}$ $\lt$ r$_{sf}$/3, where the shell formation radius  is given by  r $_{sf}$=30 pc n$_{0}$$^{-0.46}$ for  two-phase models (or 30\% smaller for a homogeneous medium).},

	Abstract = {While the evolution of superbubbles driven by clustered supernovae (SNe) has been studied by numerous authors, the resulting radial momentum yield is uncertain by as much as an order of magnitude depending on the computational methods and the assumed properties of the surrounding interstellar medium (ISM). In this work, we study the origin of these discrepancies, and seek to determine the correct momentum budget. We carry out 3D hydrodynamic and magnetohydrodynamic simulations of clustered supernova explosions, using a Lagrangian method and checking for convergence as we increase the resolution. We find that the terminal momentum of a shell driven by clustered supernovae is dictated almost entirely by the rate of mixing across the contact discontinuity between the hot and cold phases, and that this mixing rate is dominated by numerical diffusion even at the highest resolution we can achieve, 0.03 $M\_\odot$. Magnetic fields also reduce the mixing rate, so that MHD simulations produce higher momentum yields than HD ones at equal resolution. As a result, we obtain only a lower limit on the momentum yield from clustered supernovae. Combining this with our previous 1D results, which provide an upper limit because they allow almost no mixing across the contact discontinuity, we conclude that the momentum yield per SN from clustered SNe is bounded between $2\times 10^5$ and $3\times 10^6$ $M\_\odot$ km s$^{-1}$. We urge that published claims to provide a converged value for this quantity, which are based on simulations with substantially higher rates of numerical diffusion than ours, be treated with caution.},

	Abstract = {Young stars typically form in star clusters, so the supernovae (SNe) they produce are clustered in space and time. This clustering of SNe may alter the momentum per SN deposited in the interstellar medium (ISM) by affecting the local ISM density, which in turn affects the cooling rate. We study the effect of multiple SNe using idealized 1D hydrodynamic simulations which explore a large parameter space of the number of SNe, and the background gas density and metallicity. The results are provided as a table and an analytic fitting formula. We find that for clusters with up to {\tilde}100 SNe, the asymptotic momentum scales superlinearly with the number of SNe, resulting in a momentum per SN which can be an order of magnitude larger than for a single SN, with a maximum efficiency for clusters with 10-100 SNe. We argue that additional physical processes not included in our simulations - self-gravity, breakout from a galactic disc, and galactic shear - can slightly reduce the momentum enhancement from clustering, but the average momentum per SN still remains a factor of 4 larger than the isolated SN value when averaged over a realistic cluster mass function for a star-forming galaxy. We conclude with a discussion of the possible role of mixing between hot and cold gas, induced by multidimensional instabilities or pre-existing density variations, as a limiting factor in the build-up of momentum by clustered SNe, and suggest future numerical experiments to explore these effects.},

	Abstract = {Supernova (SN) feedback is one of the key processes shaping the interstellar medium (ISM) of galaxies. SNe contribute to (and in some cases may dominate) driving turbulence in the ISM and accelerating galactic winds. Modern cosmological simulations have sufficient resolution to capture the main structures in the ISM of galaxies, but are typically still not capable of explicitly resolving all of the small-scale stellar feedback processes, including the expansion of supernova remnants (SNRs). We perform a series of controlled three-dimensional hydrodynamic (adaptive mesh refinement) simulations of single SNRs expanding in an inhomogeneous density field with statistics motivated by those of the turbulent ISM. We use these to quantify the momentum and thermal energy injection from SNe as a function of spatial scale and the density, metallicity, and structure of the ambient medium. We develop a series of analytic formulae that we fit to the simulations. These formulae can be used as a basis for a more predictive sub-resolution model for SN feedback for galaxy formation simulations. We then use simulations of multiple, stochastically driven SNe that resolve the key phases of SNRs to test the sub-resolution model, and show that it accurately captures the turbulent kinetic energy and thermal energy in the ISM. By contrast, proposed SN feedback models in the literature based on `delayed cooling' significantly overpredict the late-time thermal energy and momentum in SNRs.},

	Abstract = {Galactic winds from star-forming galaxies play at key role in the evolution of galaxies and the inter-galactic medium. They transport metals out of galaxies, chemically-enriching the inter-galactic medium and modifying the chemical evolution of galaxies. They affect the surrounding inter-stellar and circum-galactic media, thereby influencing the growth of galaxies through gas accretion and star-formation. In this contribution we first summarize the physical mechanisms by which the momentum and energy output from a population of massive stars and associated supernovae can drive galactic winds. We use the proto-typical example of M82 to illustrate the multiphase nature of galactic winds. We then describe how the basic properties of galactic winds are derived from the data, and summarize how the properties of galactic winds vary systematically with the properties of the galaxies that launch them. We conclude with a brief discussion of the broad implications of galactic winds.},

	Abstract = {It is well known that cosmic rays contribute significantly to the pressure of the interstellar medium in our own Galaxy, suggesting that they may play an important role in regulating star formation during the formation and evolution of galaxies. We here discuss a novel numerical treatment of the physics of cosmic rays and its implementation in the parallel smoothed particle hydrodynamics code GADGET-2. In our methodology, the non-thermal cosmic ray population of each gaseous fluid element is approximated by a simple power law spectrum in particle momentum, characterized by an amplitude, a cut-off, and a fixed slope. Adiabatic compression and a number of physical source and sink terms are modelled which modify the cosmic ray pressure of each particle. The most important sources considered are injection by supernovae and diffusive shock acceleration, while the primary sinks are thermalization by Coulomb interactions, and catastrophic losses by hadronic interactions. We also include diffusion of cosmic rays. Using a number of test problems, we show that our scheme is numerically robust and efficient, allowing us to carry out the first cosmological structure formation simulations that account for cosmic ray physics, together with radiative cooling and star formation. In simulations of isolated galaxies, we find that cosmic rays can significantly reduce the star formation efficiencies of small galaxies, with virial velocities below  80 km s$^{-1}$, an effect that becomes progressively stronger towards low-mass scales. In cosmological simulations of the formation of dwarf galaxies at high redshift, we find that the total mass-to-light ratio of small halos and the faint end of the luminosity function are affected. The latter becomes slightly flatter. When cosmic ray acceleration in shock waves is followed as well, we find that up to 40\% of the energy dissipated at structure formation shocks can appear as cosmic ray pressure at redshifts around z{\tilde} 3$\{$-$\}$6, but this fraction drops to 10\% at low redshifts when the shock distribution becomes increasingly dominated by lower Mach numbers. Despite this large cosmic ray energy content in the high-redshift intergalactic medium, the flux power spectrum of the Lyman-{$\alpha$} forest is only affected on very small scales of k$\gt$0.1 km$^{-1s}$, and at a weak level of 5$\{$-$\}$15\%. Within virialized objects, we find lower contributions of CR-pressure, due to the increased efficiency of loss processes at higher densities, the lower Mach numbers of shocks inside halos, and the softer adiabatic index of CRs, which disadvantages them when a composite of thermal gas and cosmic rays is adiabatically compressed. The total energy in cosmic rays relative to the thermal energy within the virial radius drops from 20\% for 10$^{12}$ h$^{-1}$ $\{$M$\}$\_{\sun} halos to 5\% for rich galaxy clusters of mass 10$^{15}$ h$^{-1}$ $\{$M$\}$\_{\sun} in non-radiative simulations. Interestingly, the lower effective adiabatic index also increases the compressibility of the intrahalo medium, an effect that slightly increases the central concentration of the gas and the baryon fraction within the virial radius. We find that this can enhance the cooling rate onto central cluster galaxies, even though the galaxies in the cluster periphery become slightly less luminous as a result of cosmic ray feedback.},

	Abstract = {We present simulations of the magnetized interstellar medium (ISM) in models of massive star-forming (40 M $_{?}$ yr$^{-1}$) disk galaxies with high gas surface densities ({$\Sigma$}$_{gas}$ \~{} 100 M $_{?}$ pc$^{-2}$) similar to observed star-forming high-redshift disks. We assume that type II supernovae deposit 10\% of their energy into the ISM as cosmic rays (CRs) and neglect the additional deposition of thermal energy or momentum. With a typical Galactic diffusion coefficient for CRs (3 {\times} 10$^{28}$ cm$^{2}$ s$^{-1}$), we demonstrate that this process alone can trigger the local formation of a strong low-density galactic wind maintaining vertically open field lines. Driven by the additional pressure gradient of the relativistic fluid, the wind speed can exceed 10$^{3}$ km s$^{-1}$, much higher than the escape velocity of the galaxy. The global mass loading, i.e., the ratio of the gas mass leaving the galactic disk in a wind to the star formation rate, becomes of order unity once the system has settled into an equilibrium. We conclude that relativistic particles accelerated in supernova remnants alone provide a natural and efficient mechanism to trigger winds similar to observed mass-loaded galactic winds in high-redshift galaxies. These winds also help in explaining the low efficiencies for the conversion of gas into stars in galaxies, as well as the early enrichment of the intergalactic medium with metals. This mechanism may be at least of similar importance to the traditionally considered momentum feedback from massive stars and thermal and kinetic feedback from supernova explosions.},

	Abstract = {We present a hydrodynamical simulation of the turbulent, magnetized, supernova (SN)-driven interstellar medium (ISM) in a stratified box that dynamically couples the injection and evolution of cosmic rays (CRs) and a self-consistent evolution of the chemical composition. CRs are treated as a relativistic fluid in the advection-diffusion approximation. The thermodynamic evolution of the gas is computed using a chemical network that follows the abundances of H$^{+}$, H, H$_{2}$, CO, C$^{+}$, and free electrons and includes (self-)shielding of the gas and dust. We find that CRs perceptibly thicken the disk with the heights of 90\% (70\%) enclosed mass reaching {\gsim} 1.5 $\{$kpc$\}$ ({\gsim} 0.2 $\{$kpc$\}$). The simulations indicate that CRs alone can launch and sustain strong outflows of atomic and ionized gas with mass loading factors of order unity, even in solar neighborhood conditions and with a CR energy injection per SN of $\{$10$\}$$^{50}$ $\{$erg$\}$, 10\% of the fiducial thermal energy of an SN. The CR-driven outflows have moderate launching velocities close to the midplane ({\lsim} 100 $\{$km$\}$ $\{$$\{$$\{$s$\}$$\}$$\}$$^{-1}$) and are denser ({$\rho$} {\tilde} 10$^{-24}$-10$^{-26}$ g cm$^{-3}$), smoother, and colder than the (thermal) SN-driven winds. The simulations support the importance of CRs for setting the vertical structure of the disk as well as the driving of winds.},

	Abstract = {Galactic outflows play an important role in galactic evolution. Despite their importance, a detailed understanding of the physical mechanisms responsible for the driving of these winds is lacking. In an effort to gain more insight into the nature of these flows, we perform global three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamical simulations of an isolated Milky Way-size starburst galaxy. We focus on the dynamical role of cosmic rays (CRs) injected by supernovae, and specifically on the impact of the streaming and anisotropic diffusion of CRs along the magnetic fields. We find that these microphysical effects can have a significant effect on the wind launching and mass loading factors, depending on the details of the plasma physics. Due to the CR streaming instability, CRs propagating in the interstellar medium scatter on self-excited Alfv{\'e}n waves and couple to the gas. When the wave growth due to the streaming instability is inhibited by some damping process, such as turbulent damping, the coupling of CRs to the gas is weaker and their effective propagation speed faster than the Alfv{\'e}n speed. Alternatively, CRs could scatter from {\ldquo}extrinsic turbulence{\rdquo} that is driven by another mechanism. We demonstrate that the presence of moderately super-Alfv{\'e}nic CR streaming enhances the efficiency of galactic wind driving. Cosmic rays stream away from denser regions near the galactic disk along partially ordered magnetic fields and in the process accelerate more tenuous gas away from the galaxy. For CR acceleration efficiencies broadly consistent with the observational constraints, CRs reduce the galactic star formation rates and significantly aid in launching galactic winds.},

	Abstract = {The escape of cosmic rays from the Galaxy leads to a gradient in the cosmic ray pressure that acts as a force on the background plasma, in the direction opposite to the gravitational pull. If this force is large enough to win against gravity, a wind can be launched that removes gas from the Galaxy, thereby regulating several physical processes, including star formation. The dynamics of these cosmic ray driven winds is intrinsically non-linear in that the spectrum of cosmic rays determines the characteristics of the wind (velocity, pressure, magnetic field) and in turn the wind dynamics affects the cosmic ray spectrum. Moreover, the gradient of the cosmic ray distribution function causes excitation of Alfv{\'e}n waves, that in turn determines the scattering properties of cosmic rays, namely their diffusive transport. These effects all feed into each other so that what we see at the Earth is the result of these non-linear effects. Here, we investigate the launch and evolution of such winds, and we determine the implications for the spectrum of cosmic rays by solving together the hydrodynamical equations for the wind and the transport equation for cosmic rays under the action of self-generated diffusion and advection with the wind and the self-excited Alfv{\'e}n waves.},

	Abstract = {The spectrum and morphology of the diffuse Galactic {$\gamma$}-ray emission carries valuable information on cosmic ray (CR) propagation. Recent results obtained by analyzing Fermi-LAT data accumulated over 7 yr of observation show a substantial variation of the CR spectrum as a function of the distance from the Galactic Centre. The spatial distribution of the CR density in the outer Galaxy appears to be weakly dependent upon the galactocentric distance, as found in previous studies as well, while the density in the central region of the Galaxy was found to exceed the value measured in the outer Galaxy. At the same time, Fermi-LAT data suggest a gradual spectral softening while moving outwards from the centre of the Galaxy to its outskirts. These findings represent a challenge for standard calculations of CR propagation based on assuming a uniform diffusion coefficient within the Galactic volume. Here, we present a model of non-linear CR propagation in which transport is due to particle scattering and advection off self-generated turbulence. We find that for a realistic distribution of CR sources following the spatial distribution of supernova remnants and the space dependence of the magnetic field on galactocentric distance, both the spatial profile of CR density and the spectral softening can easily be accounted for.},

	Abstract = {The far-infrared (FIR) and radio luminosities of star-forming galaxies are linearly correlated over a very wide range in star formation rate, from normal spirals like the Milky Way to the most intense starbursts. Using one-zone models of cosmic ray (CR) injection, cooling, and escape in star-forming galaxies, we attempt to reproduce the observed FIR-radio correlation (FRC) over its entire span. The normalization and linearity of the FRC, together with constraints on the CR population in the Milky Way, have strong implications for the CR and magnetic energy densities in star-forming galaxies. We show that for consistency with the FRC, \~{}2\% of the kinetic energy from supernova explosions must go into high-energy primary CR electrons and that \~{}10\%-20\% must go into high-energy primary CR protons. Secondary electrons and positrons are likely comparable to or dominate primary electrons in dense starburst galaxies. We discuss the implications of our models for the magnetic field strengths of starbursts, the detectability of starbursts by Fermi, and CR feedback. Overall, our models indicate that both CR protons and electrons escape from low surface density galaxies, but lose most of their energy before escaping dense starbursts. The FRC is caused by a combination of the efficient cooling of CR electrons (calorimetry) in starbursts and a conspiracy of several factors. For lower surface density galaxies, the decreasing radio emission caused by CR escape is balanced by the decreasing FIR emission caused by the low effective UV dust opacity. In starbursts, bremsstrahlung, ionization, and inverse Compton cooling decrease the radio emission, but they are countered by secondary electrons/positrons and the dependence of synchrotron frequency on energy, both of which increase the radio emission. Our conclusions hold for a broad range of variations in our fiducial model, such as those including winds, different magnetic field strengths, and different diffusive escape times.},

	Abstract = {We construct one-zone steady-state models of cosmic ray (CR) injection, cooling, and escape over the entire dynamic range of the FIR-radio correlation (FRC), from normal galaxies to starbursts, over the redshift interval 0 $\lt$= z $\lt$= 10. Normal galaxies with low star formation rates become radio faint at high z, because inverse Compton (IC) losses off the cosmic microwave background (CMB) cool CR electrons and positrons rapidly, suppressing their nonthermal radio emission. However, we find that this effect occurs at higher redshifts than previously expected, because escape, bremsstrahlung, ionization, and starlight IC losses act to counter this effect and preserve the radio luminosity of galaxies. The radio dimming of star-forming galaxies at high z is not just a simple competition between magnetic field energy density and the CMB energy density; the CMB must also compete with every other loss process. We predict relations for the critical redshift when radio emission is significantly suppressed compared to the z {\ap} 0 FRC as a function of star formation rate per unit area. For example, a MilkyWay like spiral becomes radio faint at z {\ap} 2, while an M82-like starburst does not become radio faint until z {\ap} 10-20. We show that the ``buffering'' effect of non-synchrotron losses improves the detectability of star-forming galaxies in synchrotron radio emission with Expanded Very Large Array and Square Kilometer Array. Additionally, we provide a quantitative explanation for the relative radio brightness of some high-z submillimeter galaxies. We show that at fixed star formation rate surface density, galaxies with larger CR scale heights are radio bright with respect to the FRC, because of weaker bremsstrahlung and ionization losses compared to compact starbursts. We predict that these ``puffy starbursts'' should have steeper radio spectra than compact galaxies with the same star formation rate surface density. We find that radio-bright submillimeter galaxies alone cannot explain the excess radio emission reported by ARCADE2, but they may significantly enhance the diffuse radio background with respect to a naive application of the z {\ap} 0 FRC.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the momentum and energy budget of stellar feedback during different stages of stellar evolution, and study its impact on the interstellar medium (ISM) using simulations of local star-forming regions and galactic disks at the resolution affordable in modern cosmological zoom-in simulations. In particular, we present a novel subgrid model for the momentum injection due to radiation pressure and stellar winds from massive stars during early, pre-supernova (pre-SN) evolutionary stages of young star clusters. Early injection of momentum acts to clear out dense gas in star-forming regions, hence limiting star formation. The reduced gas density mitigates radiative losses of thermal feedback energy from subsequent SN explosions. The detailed impact of stellar feedback depends sensitively on the implementation and choice of parameters. Somewhat encouragingly, we find that implementations in which feedback is efficient lead to approximate self-regulation of the global star formation efficiency. We compare simulation results using our feedback implementation to other phenomenological feedback methods, where thermal feedback energy is allowed to dissipate over timescales longer than the formal gas cooling time. We find that simulations with maximal momentum injection suppress star formation to a similar degree as is found in simulations adopting adiabatic thermal feedback. However, different feedback schemes are found to produce significant differences in the density and thermodynamic structure of the ISM, and are hence expected to have a qualitatively different impact on galaxy evolution.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the star formation-feedback cycle in cosmological galaxy formation simulations, focusing on the progenitors of Milky Way (MW)-sized galaxies. We find that in order to reproduce key properties of the MW progenitors, such as semi-empirically derived star formation histories (SFHs) and the shape of rotation curves, our implementation of star formation and stellar feedback requires (1) a combination of local early momentum feedback via radiation pressure and stellar winds, and subsequent efficient supernovae feedback, and (2) an efficacy of feedback that results in the self-regulation of the global star formation rate on kiloparsec scales. We show that such feedback-driven self-regulation is achieved globally for a local star formation efficiency per free fall time of $\{$$\{${$\epsilon$} $\}$$_{ff}$$\}${\ap} 10\%. Although this value is larger that the $\{$$\{${$\epsilon$} $\}$$_{ff}$$\}${\tilde} 1\% value usually inferred from the Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) relation, we show that it is consistent with direct observational estimates of $\{$$\{${$\epsilon$} $\}$$_{ff}$$\}$ in molecular clouds. Moreover, we show that simulations with local efficiency of $\{$$\{${$\epsilon$} $\}$$_{ff}$$\}${\ap} 10\% reproduce the global observed KS relation. Such simulations also reproduce the cosmic SFH of the MW-sized galaxies and satisfy a number of other observational constraints. Conversely, we find that simulations that a priori assume an inefficient mode of star formation, instead of achieving it via stellar feedback regulation, fail to produce sufficiently vigorous outflows and do not reproduce observations. This illustrates the importance of understanding the complex interplay between star formation and feedback, and the detailed processes that contribute to the feedback-regulated formation of galaxies.},

	Abstract = {Context. Molecular clouds are known to be turbulent and strongly affected by stellar feedback. Moreover, stellar feedback is believed to drive turbulence at large scales in galaxies. <BR /> Aims: We study the role played by supernovae in molecular clouds and the influence of the magnetic field on this process. <BR /> Methods: We performed three-dimensional numerical simulations of supernova explosions, in and near turbulent self-gravitating molecular clouds. In order to study the influence of the magnetic field, we performed both hydrodynamical and magnetohydrodynamical simulations. We also ran a series of simple uniform density medium simulations and developed a simple analytical model. <BR /> Results: We find that the total amount of momentum that is delivered during supernova explosions typically varies by a factor of about 2, even when the gas density changes by 3 orders of magnitude. However, the amount of momentum delivered to the dense gas varies by almost a factor of 10 if the supernova explodes within or outside the molecular cloud. The magnetic field has little influence on the total amount of momentum injected by the supernova explosions but increases the momentum injected into the dense gas. <BR /> Conclusions: Supernovae that explode inside molecular clouds remove a significant fraction of the cloud mass. Supernovae that explode outside have a limited influence on the cloud but nevertheless remove a substantial amount of gas at densities between 1 cm$^{-3}$ and 100 cm$^{-3}$, that would be forming stars later. It is thus essential to know sufficiently well the correlation between supernovae and the surrounding dense material in order to know whether supernovae can regulate star formation effectively.

	Abstract = {Context. Galaxy evolution and star formation are two multi-scale problems tightly linked to each other. <BR /> Aims: We aim to describe simultaneously the large-scale evolution widely induced by the feedback processes and the details of the gas dynamics that controls the star formation process through gravitational collapse. This is a necessary step in understanding the interstellar cycle, which triggers galaxy evolution. <BR /> Methods: We performed a set of three-dimensional high-resolution numerical simulations of a turbulent, self-gravitating and magnetized interstellar medium within a 1 kpc stratified box with supernova feedback correlated with star-forming regions. In particular, we focussed on the role played by the magnetic field and the feedback on the galactic vertical structure, the star formation rate (SFR) and the flow dynamics. For this purpose we have varied their respective intensities. We extracted properties of the dense clouds arising from the turbulent motions and compute power spectra of various quantities. <BR /> Results: Using a distribution of supernovae sufficiently correlated with the dense gas, we find that supernova explosions can reproduce the observed SFR, particularly if the magnetic field is on the order of a few {$\mu$}G. The vertical structure, which results from a dynamical and an energy equilibrium is well reproduced by a simple analytical model, which allows us to roughly estimate the efficiency of the supernovae in driving the turbulence in the disc to be rather low, of the order of 1.5\%. Strong magnetic fields may help to increase this efficiency by a factor of between two and three. To characterize the flow we compute the power spectra of various quantities in 3D but also in 2D in order to account for the stratification of the galactic disc. We find that within our setup, the compressive modes tend to dominate in the equatorial plane, while at about one scale height above it, solenoidal modes become dominant. We measured the angle between the magnetic and velocity fields and we conclude that they tend to be well aligned particularly at high magnetization and lower feedback. Finally, the dense structures present scaling relations that are reminiscent of the observational ones. The virial parameter is typically larger than 10 and shows a large spread of masses below 1000 M$_{?}$. For masses larger than 10$^{4}$M$_{?}$, its value tends to a few. <BR /> Conclusions: Using a relatively simple scheme for the supernova feedback, which is self-consistently proportional to the SFR and spatially correlated to the star formation process, we reproduce a stratified galactic disc that presents reasonable scale height, SFR as well as a cloud distribution with characteristics close to the observed ones.},

	Abstract = {When a charged particle moves through a plasma at a speed much higher than the thermal velocity of the plasma, it is subjected to the force of the electrostatic field induced in the plasma by itself and loses its energy. This process is well-known as the stopping power of a plasma. In this paper we show that the same process works in particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations as well and the energy loss rate of fast particles due to this process is mainly determined by the number of plasma electrons contained in the electron skin depth volume. However, since there are generally very few particles in that volume in PIC simulations compared with real plasmas, the energy loss effect can be exaggerated significantly and can affect the results. Therefore, especially for the simulations that investigate the particle acceleration processes, the number of particles used in the simulations should be chosen large enough to avoid this artificial energy loss.},

	Abstract = {The transport of cosmic rays (CRs) is crucial for the understanding of almost all high-energy phenomena. Both pre-existing large-scale magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence and locally generated turbulence through plasma instabilities are important for the CR propagation in astrophysical media. The potential role of the resonant instability triggered by CR pressure anisotropy to regulate the parallel spatial diffusion of low-energy CRs ({\lsim} 100 GeV) in the interstellar and intracluster medium of galaxies (ISM and ICM) has been showed in previous theoretical works. This work aims to study the gyroresonance instability via direct numerical simulations, in order to access quantitatively the wave-particle scattering rates. For this we employ a 1D PIC-MHD code to follow the growth and saturation of the gyroresonance instability. We extract from the simulations the pitch-angle diffusion coefficient D$_{??}$ produced by the instability during the linear and saturation phases, and a very good agreement (within a factor of 3) is found with the values predicted by the quasilinear theory (QLT). Our results support the applicability of the QLT for modeling the scattering of low-energy CRs by the gyroresonance instability in the complex interplay between this instability and the large-scale MHD turbulence.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the early impact of single and binary supernova (SN) explosions on dense gas clouds with three-dimensional, high-resolution, hydrodynamic simulations. The effect of cloud structure, radiative cooling and ionizing radiation from the progenitor stars on the net input of kinetic energy, f$_{kin}$ = E$_{kin}$/E$_{SN}$, thermal energy, f$_{therm}$ = E$_{therm}$/E$_{SN}$, and gas momentum, f$_{P}$ = P/P$_{SN}$, to the interstellar medium (ISM) is tested. For clouds with bar$\{$n$\}$ = 100cm\^{}$\{$-3$\}$, the momentum generating Sedov and pressure-driven snowplough phases are terminated early ({\prop}0.01 Myr) and radiative cooling limits the coupling to f$_{therm}$ {\tilde} 0.01, f$_{kin}$ {\tilde} 0.05, and f$_{P}$ {\tilde} 9, significantly lower than for the case without cooling. For pre-ionized clouds, these numbers are only increased by {\tilde}50 per cent, independent of the cloud structure. This only suffices to accelerate {\tilde}5 per cent of the cloud to radial velocities {\gsim}30 km s$^{-1}$. A second SN might enhance the coupling efficiencies if delayed past the Sedov phase of the first explosion. Such very low coupling efficiencies cast doubts on many subresolution models for SN feedback, which are, in general, validated a posteriori. Ionizing radiation appears not to significantly enhance the coupling of SNe to the surrounding gas as it drives the ISM into inert dense shells and cold clumps, a process which is unresolved in galaxy-scale simulations. Our results indicate that the momentum input of SNe in ionized, structured clouds is larger (more than a factor of 10) than the corresponding momentum yield of the progenitor's stellar winds.},

	Abstract = {To uniformly determine the properties of supernova remnants (SNRs) at high energies, we have developed the first systematic survey at energies from 1 to 100 GeV using data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT). Based on the spatial overlap of sources detected at GeV energies with SNRs known from radio surveys, we classify 30 sources as likely GeV SNRs. We also report 14 marginal associations and 245 flux upper limits. A mock catalog in which the positions of known remnants are scrambled in Galactic longitude allows us to determine an upper limit of 22\% on the number of GeV candidates falsely identified as SNRs. We have also developed a method to estimate spectral and spatial systematic errors arising from the diffuse interstellar emission model, a key component of all Galactic Fermi LAT analyses. By studying remnants uniformly in aggregate, we measure the GeV properties common to these objects and provide a crucial context for the detailed modeling of individual SNRs. Combining our GeV results with multiwavelength (MW) data, including radio, X-ray, and TeV, we demonstrate the need for improvements to previously sufficient, simple models describing the GeV and radio emission from these objects. We model the GeV and MW emission from SNRs in aggregate to constrain their maximal contribution to observed Galactic cosmic rays.},

In the numerically simulated example (ejecta mass of 3 M\_sun;, ambient hydrogen density of 0.1 cm$^{-3}$), the radiative stage begins after less than one sound crossing time from the end of the free-expansion stage, and as a result the interior of the blast wave never completely settles to the Sedov-Taylor similarity solution.

	Abstract = {There is evidence that cosmic rays were present in galaxies at moderately high redshift. This suggests that magnetic fields were also present. If cosmic rays and magnetic fields must always be close to equipartition, as they are to an order of magnitude within the local universe, this would provide a powerful constraint on theories of the origin and evolution of magnetic fields in galaxies. We evaluate the role of magnetic field strength in cosmic-ray acceleration and confinement. We find that the properties of small-scale hydromagnetic turbulence are fundamentally changed in the presence of cosmic rays. As a result, magnetic fields several orders of magnitude weaker than present galactic fields can accelerate and retain a population of relativistic cosmic rays, provided that the fields are coherent over length scales greater than a cosmic-ray gyroradius.},

	Abstract = {The much-anticipated proof of cosmic ray (CR) acceleration in supernova remnants must hinge on the full consistency of acceleration theory with the observations; direct proof is impossible because of CR-orbit scrambling. Recent observations indicate deviations between helium and proton CR rigidity spectra inconsistent with the theory. By considering an initial (injection) phase of the diffusive shock acceleration, where elemental similarity does not apply, we demonstrate that the spectral difference is, in fact, a unique signature of the acceleration mechanism. Collisionless shocks inject more He$^{2+}$ when they are stronger and so produce harder He$^{2+}$ spectra. The injection bias is due to Alfv{\'e}n waves driven by the more abundant protons, so the He$^{2+}$ ions are harder to trap by these waves. By fitting the p/He ratio to the PAMELA data, we bolster the diffusive shock acceleration case for resolving the century-old mystery of CR origin.},

	Abstract = {Relativistic outflows carrying large scale magnetic fields have large inductive potential and may accelerate protons to ultra high energies. We discuss a novel scheme of Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Ray (UHECR) acceleration due to drifts in magnetized, cylindrically collimated, sheared jets of powerful active galaxies (with jet luminosity {\ges}10$^{46}$ erg s $^{-1}$). We point out that a positively charged particle carried by such a plasma is in an unstable equilibrium if B{\middot}{\nabla}{\times}v$\lt$0, so that kinetic drift along the velocity shear would lead to fast, regular energy gain. This can be achieved in an axially inhomogeneous jet through gradient drift induced by propagation of inertial Alfv{\'e}n waves along the jet. We show that if a seed of pre-accelerated particles with energy below the ankle {\les}10$^{18}$eV is present, these particles can be boosted to energies above 10$^{19}$eV. A key feature of the mechanism is that the highest rigidity (ratio of energy to charge) particles are accelerated most efficiently implying the dominance of light nuclei for energies above the ankle in our model: from a mixed population of pre-accelerated particle the drift mechanism picks up and boosts protons preferably. In addition, after a particle traversed large fraction of the available potential, its Larmor radius becomes of the order of the jet thickness. In this case, the maximum possible acceleration rate of inverse relativistic gyro-frequency is achieved and a particle finally become unconfined and leave the jet. The power-law spectrum of the resulting UHE particles flattens with time and asymptotically may become {\prop}E$^{-2}$. The real injection spectrum depends on the distribution of pre-accelerated particles inside a jet and, in case of contribution from many sources, on the distribution of total potential drop. We also point out that astrophysical schemes based on DC-type acceleration (by electric field parallel to or larger than magnetic field) cannot have potentials larger than {\tilde}10$^{15}$V and thus fell short by many orders of magnitude to produce UHECRs.},

	Abstract = {We study the implementation of mechanical feedback from supernovae (SNe) and stellar mass loss in galaxy simulations, within the Feedback In Realistic Environments (FIRE) project. We present the FIRE-2 algorithm for coupling mechanical feedback, which can be applied to any hydrodynamics method (e.g. fixed-grid, moving-mesh, and mesh-less methods), and black hole as well as stellar feedback. This algorithm ensures manifest conservation of mass, energy, and momentum, and avoids imprinting `preferred directions' on the ejecta. We show that it is critical to incorporate both momentum and thermal energy of mechanical ejecta in a self-consistent manner, accounting for SNe cooling radii when they are not resolved. Using idealized simulations of single SN explosions, we show that the FIRE-2 algorithm, independent of resolution, reproduces converged solutions in both energy and momentum. In contrast, common `fully thermal' (energy-dump) or `fully kinetic' (particle-kicking) schemes in the literature depend strongly on resolution: when applied at mass resolution {\gsim}100 M$_{?}$, they diverge by orders of magnitude from the converged solution. In galaxy-formation simulations, this divergence leads to orders-of-magnitude differences in galaxy properties, unless those models are adjusted in a resolution-dependent way. We show that all models that individually time-resolve SNe converge to the FIRE-2 solution at sufficiently high resolution ($\lt$100 M$_{?}$). However, in both idealized single-SN simulations and cosmological galaxy-formation simulations, the FIRE-2 algorithm converges much faster than other sub-grid models without re-tuning parameters.},

	Abstract = {We introduce an updated physical model to simulate the formation and evolution of galaxies in cosmological, large-scale gravity+magnetohydrodynamical simulations with the moving mesh code AREPO. The overall framework builds upon the successes of the Illustris galaxy formation model, and includes prescriptions for star formation, stellar evolution, chemical enrichment, primordial and metal-line cooling of the gas, stellar feedback with galactic outflows, and black hole formation, growth and multimode feedback. In this paper, we give a comprehensive description of the physical and numerical advances that form the core of the IllustrisTNG (The Next Generation) framework. We focus on the revised implementation of the galactic winds, of which we modify the directionality, velocity, thermal content and energy scalings, and explore its effects on the galaxy population. As described in earlier works, the model also includes a new black-hole-driven kinetic feedback at low accretion rates, magnetohydrodynamics and improvements to the numerical scheme. Using a suite of (25 Mpc h$^{-1}$)$^{3}$ cosmological boxes, we assess the outcome of the new model at our fiducial resolution. The presence of a self-consistently amplified magnetic field is shown to have an important impact on the stellar content of 10$^{12}$ M$_{?}$ haloes and above. Finally, we demonstrate that the new galactic winds promise to solve key problems identified in Illustris in matching observational constraints and affecting the stellar content and sizes of the low-mass end of the galaxy population.},

	Abstract = {We report on the acceleration properties of 329 features in 95 blazar jets from the MOJAVE Very Long Baseline Array program. Nearly half the features and three-quarters of the jets show significant changes in speed and/or direction. In general, apparent speed changes are distinctly larger than changes in direction, indicating that changes in the Lorentz factors of jet features dominate the observed speed changes rather than bends along the line of sight. Observed accelerations tend to increase the speed of features near the jet base, $\lt$\~{} 10-20 pc projected, and decrease their speed at longer distances. The range of apparent speeds at a fixed distance in an individual jet can span a factor of a few, indicating that shock properties and geometry may influence the apparent motions; however, we suggest that the broad trend of jet features increasing their speed near the origin is due to an overall acceleration of the jet flow out to deprojected distances of the order of 10$^{2}$ pc, beyond which the flow begins to decelerate or remains nearly constant in speed. We estimate intrinsic rates of change of the Lorentz factors in the galaxy frame of the order of $\backslash$dot$\{${$\Gamma$} $\}$/{$\Gamma$} {\sime} 10$^{-3}$ to 10$^{-2}$ yr$^{-1}$, which can lead to total Lorentz factor changes of a factor of a few on the length scales observed here. Finally, we also find evidence for jet collimation at projected distances of $\lt$\~{} 10 pc in the form of the non-radial motion and bending accelerations that tend to better align features with the inner jet.},

	Abstract = {Cosmic rays escaping the Galaxy exert a force on the interstellar medium directed away from the Galactic disc. If this force is larger than the gravitational pull due to the mass embedded in the Galaxy, then galactic winds may be launched. Such outflows may have important implications for the history of star formation of the host galaxy, and in turn affect in a crucial way the transport of cosmic rays, both due to advection with the wind and to the excitation of waves by the same cosmic rays, through streaming instability. The possibility to launch cosmic ray-induced winds and the properties of such winds depend on environmental conditions, such as the density and temperature of the plasma at the base of the wind and the gravitational potential, especially the one contributed by the dark matter halo. In this paper, we make a critical assessment of the possibility to launch cosmic ray-induced winds for a Milky Way-like galaxy and how the properties of the wind depend upon the conditions at the base of the wind. Special attention is devoted to the implications of different conditions for wind launching on the spectrum of cosmic rays observed at different locations in the disc of the galaxy. We also comment on how cosmic ray-induced winds compare with recent observations of Oxygen absorption lines in quasar spectra and emission lines from blank sky, as measured by XMM-Newton/EPIC-MOS.},

	Abstract = {Several young supernova remnants (SNRs) exhibit thin X-ray bright rims of synchrotron radiation at their forward shocks. Thin rims require strong magnetic field amplification beyond simple shock compression if rim widths are only limited by electron energy losses. But, magnetic field damping behind the shock could produce similarly thin rims with less extreme field amplification. Variation of rim width with energy may thus discriminate between competing influences on rim widths. We measured rim widths around Tycho's SNR in five energy bands using an archival 750 ks Chandra observation. Rims narrow with increasing energy and are well described by either loss-limited or damped scenarios, so X-ray rim width-energy dependence does not uniquely specify a model. But, radio counterparts to thin rims are not loss-limited and better reflect magnetic field structure. Joint radio and X-ray modeling favors magnetic damping in Tycho's SNR with damping lengths {\tilde}1\%-5\% of remnant radius and magnetic field strengths {\tilde}50-400 {$\mu$}G assuming Bohm diffusion. X-ray rim widths are {\tilde}1\% of remnant radius, somewhat smaller than inferred damping lengths. Electron energy losses are important in all models of X-ray rims, suggesting that the distinction between loss-limited and damped models is blurred in soft X-rays. All loss-limited and damping models require magnetic fields {\gsim}20 {$\mu$}G, affirming the necessity of magnetic field amplification beyond simple compression.},

For the typical luminosities invoked for such sources, the electric current associated to the flux of cosmic rays that leave them is large.

We argue that this phenomenon forces cosmic rays to be self-confined in the source proximity for energies E $\lt$E$_{cut}$, where E$_{cut}${\ap}10$^{7}$L$_{44}$$^{2 /3}$ GeV for low background magnetic fields (B$_{0}${\Lt}nG ).

	Abstract = {Protons and helium nuclei are the most abundant components of the cosmic radiation. Precise measurements of their fluxes are needed to understand the acceleration and subsequent propagation of cosmic rays in our Galaxy. We report precision measurements of the proton and helium spectra in the rigidity range 1 gigavolt to 1.2 teravolts performed by the satellite-borne experiment PAMELA (payload for antimatter matter exploration and light-nuclei astrophysics). We find that the spectral shapes of these two species are different and cannot be described well by a single power law. These data challenge the current paradigm of cosmic-ray acceleration in supernova remnants followed by diffusive propagation in the Galaxy. More complex processes of acceleration and propagation of cosmic rays are required to explain the spectral structures observed in our data.},

	Abstract = {We present the results of a numerical simulation of propagation of cosmic rays with energy above 10$^{15}$ eV in a complex magnetic field, made in general of a large scale component and a turbulent component. Several configurations are investigated that may represent specific aspects of a realistic magnetic field of the Galaxy, though the main purpose of this investigation is not to achieve a realistic description of the propagation in the Galaxy, but rather to assess the role of several effects that define the complex problem of propagation. Our simulations of cosmic rays in the Galaxy will be presented in paper II. We identified several effects that are difficult to interpret in a purely diffusive approach and that play a crucial role in the propagation of cosmic rays in the complex magnetic field of the Galaxy. We discuss at length the problem of the extrapolation of our results to much lower energies where data are available on the confinement time of cosmic rays in the Galaxy. The confinement time and its dependence on particles' rigidity are crucial ingredients for (1) relating the source spectrum to the observed cosmic ray spectrum; (2) quantifying the production of light elements by spallation; (3) predicting the anisotropy as a function of energy.},

	Abstract = {We continue to investigate the possibility that interstellar turbulence is caused by nonlinear interactions among shear Alfven waves. Here, we restrict attention to the symmetric case where the oppositely directed waves carry equal energy fluxes. This precludes application to the solar wind in which the outward flux significantly exceeds the ingoing one. All our detailed calculations are carried out for an incompressible magnetized fluid. In incompressible magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), nonlinear interactions only occur between oppositely direct waves. We present a theory for the strong turbulence of shear Alfven waves. It has the following main characteristics. (1) The inertial-stage energy spectrum exhibits a critical balance between linear wave periods and nonlinear turnover timescales. (2) The 'eddies' are elongated in the direction of the field on small spatial scales; the parallel and perpendicular components of the wave vector, k$_{z}$ and k(perpendicular) are related by k$_{z}$ approximately equals k$_{perpendicular to}$$^{2/3}$ L$^{-1/3}$, where L is the outer scale of the turbulence. (3) The 'one-dimensional' energy spectrum is proportional to k$_{perpendicular}$$^{-5/3}$-an anisotropic Kolmogorov energy spectrum. Shear Alfvenic turbulence mixes specific entropy as a passive contaminant. This gives rise to an electron density power spectrum whose form mimics the energy spectrum of the turbulence. Radio wave scattering by these electron density fluctuations produces anisotropic scatter-broadened images. Damping by ion-neutral collisions restricts Alfvenic turbulence to highly ionized regions of the interstellar medium.},

	Abstract = {The ratio of the fluxes of secondary and primary nuclei in cosmic rays has long been used as an indicator of the grammage traversed in the journey of cosmic ray particles throughout the Galaxy. The basic idea is that primary particles are accelerated in astrophysical sources, such as supernova remnant shocks and eventually propagate in the Galactic volume, occasionally interacting with gas, mainly in the disc of the Galaxy, and there they produce secondary nuclei through spallation. At sufficiently high energy, typically {\gsim}100 GeV/n, the ratio of fluxes of the secondary nucleus to that of the main primary nucleus is found to scale as E$_{k}$\^{}$\{$-{$\delta$} $\}$, where E$_{k}$ is the energy per nucleon (a conserved quantity in spallation reactions) and {$\delta$} identifies the energy dependence of the diffusion coefficient. The same shock waves that may be responsible for cosmic ray acceleration in the first place also pick up any other charged particle in the upstream, provided being above threshold for injection. The secondary nuclei produced by spallation in the interstellar medium are no exception, hence they also get accelerated. This effect is unavoidable, only its strength may be subject of debate. We compute the spectrum of secondary elements such as boron and lithium taking into account shock reacceleration and compare our predictions with the recent observations of the B/C ratio and preliminary measurements of the boron and lithium flux. Both these sets of data seem to confirm that reacceleration of secondary nuclei indeed plays an important role, thereby affecting the validity of those scaling rules that are often used in cosmic ray physics.},

	Abstract = {Cosmic rays that escape their acceleration site interact with the ambient medium and produce gamma rays as the result of inelastic proton-proton collisions. The detection of such diffuse emission may reveal the presence of an accelerator of cosmic rays, and also constrain the cosmic ray diffusion coefficient in its vicinity. Preliminary results in this direction have been obtained in the last few years from studies of the gamma-ray emission from molecular clouds located in the vicinity of supernova remnants, which are the prime candidates for cosmic ray production. Hints have been found for a significant suppression of the diffusion coefficient with respect to the average one in the Galaxy. However, most of these studies rely on the assumption of isotropic diffusion, which may not be very well justified. Here, we extend this study to the case in which cosmic rays that escape an accelerator diffuse preferentially along the magnetic field lines. As a first approximation, we further assume that particles are strongly magnetized and that their transport perpendicular to the magnetic field is mainly due to the wandering of the field lines. The resulting spatial distribution of runaway cosmic rays around the accelerator is, in this case, strongly anisotropic. An application of the model to the case of the supernova remnant W28 demonstrates how the estimates of the diffusion coefficient from gamma-ray observations strongly depend on the assumptions made on the isotropy (or anisotropy) of diffusion. For higher levels of anisotropy of the diffusion, larger values of the diffusion coefficient are found to provide a good fit to data. Thus, detailed models for the propagation of cosmic rays are needed in order to interpret in a correct way the gamma-ray observations.},

	Abstract = {Supernova remnants are believed to be the main sources of galactic cosmic rays (CR). Within this framework, particles are accelerated at supernova remnant shocks and then released in the interstellar medium. The mechanism through which CRs are released and the way in which they propagate still remain open issues. The main difficulty is the high non-linearity of the problem: CRs themselves excite the magnetic turbulence that confines them close to their sources. We solve numerically the coupled differential equations describing the evolution in space and time of the escaping particles and of the waves generated through the CR streaming instability. The warm ionized and warm neutral phases of the interstellar medium are considered. These phases occupy the largest fraction of the disc volume, where most supernovae explode, and are characterized by the significant presence of neutral particles. The friction between those neutrals and ions results in a very effective wave damping mechanism. It is found that streaming instability affects the propagation of CRs even in the presence of ion-neutral friction. The diffusion coefficient can be suppressed by more than a factor of {\tilde}2 over a region of few tens of pc around the remnant. The suppression increases for smaller distances. The propagation of {\ap}10 GeV particles is affected for several tens of kiloyears after escape, while {\ap}1 TeV particles are affected for few kiloyears. This might have a great impact on the interpretation of gamma-ray observations of molecular clouds located in the vicinity of supernova remnants.},

@article{padovani+17,
	Abstract = {It is largely accepted that Galactic cosmic rays, which pervade the interstellar medium, originate by means of shock waves in supernova remnants. Cosmic rays activate the rich chemistry that is observed in a molecular cloud and they also regulate its collapse timescale, determining the efficiency of star and planet formation, but they cannot penetrate up to the densest part of a molecular cloud, where the formation of stars is expected, because of energy loss processes and magnetic field deflections. Recently, observations towards young protostellar systems showed a surprisingly high value of the ionisation rate, the main indicator of the presence of cosmic rays in molecular cloud. Synchrotron emission, the typical feature of relativistic electrons, has also been detected towards the bow shock of a T Tauri star. Nevertheless, the origin of these signatures peculiar to accelerated particles is still puzzling. Here we show that particle acceleration can be driven by shock waves occurring in protostars through the first-order Fermi acceleration mechanism. We expect that shocks in protostellar jets can be efficient accelerators of protons, which can be boosted up to mildly relativistic energies. A strong acceleration can also take place at the protostellar surface, where shocks produced by infalling material during the phase of collapse are powerful enough to accelerate protons. Our model shows that thermal particles can experience an acceleration during the first phases of a system similar to the proto-Sun, and can also be used to explain recent observations. The presence of a local source of cosmic rays may have an unexpected impact over the process of the formation of stars and planets, as well as on the pre-biotic molecule formation.},

	Abstract = {The afterglow emission from gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) is usually interpreted as synchrotron radiation from electrons accelerated at the GRB external shock that propagates with relativistic velocities into the magnetized interstellar medium. By means of multi-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations, we investigate the acceleration performance of weakly magnetized relativistic shocks, in the magnetization range 0 $\lt$\~{} {$\sigma$} $\lt$\~{} 10$^{-1}$. The pre-shock magnetic field is orthogonal to the flow, as generically expected for relativistic shocks. We find that relativistic perpendicular shocks propagating in electron-positron plasmas are efficient particle accelerators if the magnetization is {$\sigma$} $\lt$\~{} 10$^{-3}$. For electron-ion plasmas, the transition to efficient acceleration occurs for {$\sigma$} $\lt$\~{} 3 {\times} 10$^{-5}$. Here, the acceleration process proceeds similarly for the two species, since the electrons enter the shock nearly in equipartition with the ions, as a result of strong pre-heating in the self-generated upstream turbulence. In both electron-positron and electron-ion shocks, we find that the maximum energy of the accelerated particles scales in time as {$\epsilon$}$_{max}$vpropt $^{1/2}$. This scaling is shallower than the so-called (and commonly assumed) Bohm limit {$\epsilon$}$_{max}$vpropt, and it naturally results from the small-scale nature of the Weibel turbulence generated in the shock layer. In magnetized plasmas, the energy of the accelerated particles increases until it reaches a saturation value {$\epsilon$}$_{sat}$/{$\gamma$}$_{0}$ m$_{i}$c $^{2}$ \~{} {$\sigma$}$^{-1/4}$, where {$\gamma$}$_{0}$ m$_{i}$c $^{2}$ is the mean energy per particle in the upstream bulk flow. Further energization is prevented by the fact that the self-generated turbulence is confined within a finite region of thickness vprop{$\sigma$}$^{-1/2}$ around the shock. Our results can provide physically grounded inputs for models of non-thermal emission from a variety of astrophysical sources, with particular relevance to GRB afterglows.},

A certain fraction of galactic cosmic rays in a halo is entrained, and sufficiently high-energy particles can be injected to the reacceleration process and further accelerated up to 100 EeV. We show that the shear reacceleration mechanism leads to a hard spectrum of escaping cosmic rays, d L$_{E}$/d E {\prop}E$^{-1}$-E$^{0}$, distinct from a conventional E$^{-2}$ spectrum. The supersolar abundance of ultrahigh-energy nuclei is achieved due to injections at TeV-PeV energies.

The uncertainty on the energy scales of individual experiments is handled explicitly in our mathematical approach.

	Abstract = {Tycho's supernova remnant (SNR) is well-established as a source of particle acceleration to very high energies. Constraints from numerous studies indicate that the observed {$\gamma$}-ray emission results primarily from hadronic processes, providing direct evidence of highly relativistic ions that have been accelerated by the SNR. Here we present an investigation of the dynamical and spectral evolution of Tycho's SNR by carrying out hydrodynamical simulations that include diffusive shock acceleration of particles in the amplified magnetic field at the forward shock of the SNR. Our simulations provide a consistent view of the shock positions, the nonthermal emission, the thermal X-ray emission from the forward shock, and the brightness profiles of the radio and X-ray emission. We compare these with the observed properties of Tycho to determine the density of the ambient material, the particle acceleration efficiency and maximum energy, the accelerated electron-to-proton ratio, and the properties of the shocked gas downstream of the expanding SNR shell. We find that evolution of a typical Type Ia supernova in a low ambient density (n $_{0}$ \~{} 0.3 cm$^{-3}$), with an upstream magnetic field of \~{}5 {$\mu$}G, and with \~{}16\% of the SNR kinetic energy being converted into relativistic electrons and ions through diffusive shock acceleration, reproduces the observed properties of Tycho. Under such a scenario, the bulk of observed {$\gamma$}-ray emission at high energies is produced by {$\pi$}$^{0}$-decay resulting from the collisions of energetic hadrons, while inverse-Compton emission is significant at lower energies, comprising roughly half of the flux between 1 and 10 GeV.},

	Abstract = {We discuss the origin of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) in the energy range above 10$^{18.5}$ eV where it is indicated that the spectrum becomes protonic and extends smoothly up to at least 10$^{19.5}$ eV and is consistent with a smooth extension to 10$^{20.5}$ eV. The acceleration of the 10$^{19.5}$ eV component must occur within {\tilde}1 Gpc. We rule out the production and escape of protons and neutrons from active galactic nuclei. Composition arguments make unlikely any origin in metal-rich environments such as rich clusters and the inner regions of galaxies. We dismiss the canonical extended halo models since such halos are almost never observed although diffuse halos have been seen in QSO absorption-line studies of metallic absorption lines. Large-scale shocks from explosions and winds are analyzed including those originating both recently and at earlier cosmological epochs. Large-scale shocks can work well only if they occur in microgauss fields. Hot spots and cocoons of radio sources are a plausible source for UHECRs with the principal uncertainty in both cases being the adopted or inferred magnetic field strength. Cosmic shocks are formed as structure develops during gravitational collapse of primordial perturbations such as are found in the standard cosmological models in, for example, both pancakes and collisions of hierarchical merging subunits. Cosmic shocks can be good sites for UHECR acceleration if there is a primordial field of order {\gsim} 10$^{-9}$ G or, again, if microgauss fields can be self-generated in shocks. Table 1 summarizes the results of our analysis of all the conventional possibilities and indicates that jets, radio source cocoons, structure formation in clusters superclusters, and large-scale structures are all reasonable sources for the production of UHECRs.  We examine the possibility of a second-stage diffuse acceleration process from an ensemble of shocks that might explain the highest energy particles above 100 EeV by boosting their energy from 30 to 300 EeV into a diffuse isotropic component. Table 2 summarizes our results and indicates that at the present time there is as yet no such candidate ensemble of shocks that has both the power and the volume-filling factor to achieve this effect. The highest energy cosmic rays must therefore have been accelerated in one stage from their parent object.},

	Abstract = {We present a versatile family of model galactic outflows including non-uniform mass and energy source distributions, a gravitational potential from an extended mass source, and radiative losses. The model easily produces steady-state wind solutions for a range of mass-loading factors, energy-loading factors, galaxy mass, and galaxy radius. We find that, with radiative losses included, highly mass-loaded winds must be driven at high central temperatures, whereas low mass-loaded winds can be driven at low temperatures just above the peak of the cooling curve, meaning radiative losses can drastically affect the wind solution even for low mass-loading factors. By including radiative losses, we are able to show that subsonic flows can be ignored as a possible mechanism for expelling mass and energy from a galaxy compared to the more efficient transonic solutions. Specifically, the transonic solutions with low mass loading and high energy loading are the most efficient. Our model also produces low-temperature, high-velocity winds that could explain the prevalence of low-temperature material in observed outflows. Finally, we show that our model, unlike the well-known Chevalier {\amp} Clegg model, can reproduce the observed linear relationship between wind X-ray luminosity and star formation rate (SFR) over a large range of SFR from 1-1000 M$_{?}$ yr$^{-1}$ assuming the wind mass-loading factor is higher for low-mass, and hence, low-SFR galaxies. We also constrain the allowed mass-loading factors that can fit the observed X-ray luminosity versus SFR trend, further suggesting an inverse relationship between mass loading and SFR as explored in advanced numerical simulations.},

	Abstract = {There are two distinct breaks in the cosmic ray (CR) spectrum: the so-called {\ldquo}knee{\rdquo} around 3 {\times} 10$^{15}$ eV and the so-called {\ldquo}ankle{\rdquo} around 10$^{18}$ eV. Diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) at supernova remnant (SNR) shock fronts is thought to accelerate galactic CRs to energies below the knee, while an extragalactic origin is presumed for CRs with energies beyond the ankle. CRs with energies between 3 {\times} 10$^{15}$ and 10$^{18}$ eV, which we dub the {\ldquo}shin,{\rdquo} have an unknown origin. It has been proposed that DSA at galactic wind termination shocks, rather than at SNR shocks, may accelerate CRs to these energies. This paper uses the galactic wind model of Bustard et al. to analyze whether galactic wind termination shocks may accelerate CRs to shin energies within a reasonable acceleration time and whether such CRs can subsequently diffuse back to the Galaxy. We argue for acceleration times on the order of 100 Myr rather than a few billion years, as assumed in some previous works, and we discuss prospects for magnetic field amplification at the shock front. Ultimately, we generously assume that the magnetic field is amplified to equipartition. This formalism allows us to obtain analytic formulae, applicable to any wind model, for CR acceleration. Even with generous assumptions, we find that very high wind velocities are required to set up the necessary conditions for acceleration beyond 10$^{17}$ eV. We also estimate the luminosities of CRs accelerated by outflow termination shocks, including estimates for the Milky Way wind.},

	Abstract = {Galactic winds and fountains driven by supernova-heated gas play an integral role in redistributing gas in galaxies, depositing metals in the circumgalactic medium, and quenching star formation. The interplay between these outflows and ram-pressure stripping (RPS) due to the galaxy{\rsquo}s motion through an ambient medium may enhance these effects by converting fountain flows into expelled gas. In this paper, we present controlled, 3D simulations of RPS combined with thermally driven, local outflows from clustered supernovae in an isolated disk galaxy modeled on the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), a dwarf satellite of the Milky Way on its first infall. Observational evidence of local outflows emanating from supergiant shells in the LMC and a trailing filament of H I gas originating from these regions{\mdash}with no obvious Leading Arm counterpart{\mdash}may represent a perfect example of this process. Our simulations present a proof of concept that ram pressure can convert fountain flows into expelled gas. We find that fountains launched near the peak star formation time of the LMC can comprise part of the LMC filament in the Trailing Stream but with lower column densities than observed. Larger, more numerous outflows from the LMC may be possible and may contribute more mass, but higher-inertia gas will lengthen the timescale for this gas to be swept away by ram pressure. Given the high-resolution observations, increased knowledge of star formation histories, and growing evidence of multiphase ionized outflows, the LMC is an ideal test bed for future wind models.},

	Abstract = {The discovery of novae as sources of {\tilde}0.1-1 GeV gamma-rays highlights the key role of shocks and relativistic particle acceleration in these transient systems. Although there is evidence for a spectral cut-off above energies {\tilde}1-100 GeV at particular epochs in some novae, the maximum particle energy achieved in these accelerators has remained an open question. The high densities of the nova ejecta ({\tilde}10 orders of magnitude larger than in supernova remnants) render the gas far upstream of the shock neutral and shielded from ionizing radiation. The amplification of the magnetic field needed for diffusive shock acceleration requires ionized gas, thus confining the acceleration process to a narrow photoionized layer immediately ahead of the shock. Based on the growth rate of the hybrid non-resonant cosmic ray current-driven instability (considering also ion-neutral damping), we quantify the maximum particle energy, E$_{max}$, across the range of shock velocities and upstream densities of interest. We find values of E$_{max}$ {\tilde} 10 GeV-10 TeV, which are broadly consistent with the inferred spectral cut-offs, but which could also in principle lead to emission extending to {\gsim} 100 GeV accessible to atmosphere Cherenkov telescopes, such as the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA). Detecting TeV neutrinos with IceCube is more challenging, although the prospects are improved for a nearby event ({\lsim} kpc) or if the shock power during the earliest, densest phases of the outburst is higher than implied by the GeV light curves, due to downscattering of the gamma-rays within the ejecta.},

	Abstract = {We report on deep Chandra observations of the nearby broad-line radio galaxy Pictor A, which we combine with new Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) observations. The new X-ray data have a factor of 4 more exposure than observations previously presented and span a 15 yr time baseline, allowing a detailed study of the spatial, temporal and spectral properties of the AGN, jet, hotspot and lobes. We present evidence for further time variation of the jet, though the flare that we reported in previous work remains the most significantly detected time-varying feature. We also confirm previous tentative evidence for a faint counterjet. Based on the radio through X-ray spectrum of the jet and its detailed spatial structure, and on the properties of the counterjet, we argue that inverse-Compton models can be conclusively rejected, and propose that the X-ray emission from the jet is synchrotron emission from particles accelerated in the boundary layer of a relativistic jet. For the first time, we find evidence that the bright western hotspot is also time-varying in X-rays, and we connect this to the small-scale structure in the hotspot seen in high-resolution radio observations. The new data allow us to confirm that the spectrum of the lobes is in good agreement with the predictions of an inverse-Compton model and we show that the data favour models in which the filaments seen in the radio images are predominantly the result of spatial variation of magnetic fields in the presence of a relatively uniform electron distribution.},

	Abstract = {Supernova remnants (SNRs) in Local Group galaxies offer unique insights into the origin of different types of supernovae (SNe). In order to take full advantage of these insights, one must understand the intrinsic and environmental diversity of SNRs in the context of their host galaxies. We introduce a semi-analytic model that reproduces the statistical properties of a radio continuum-selected SNR population, taking into account the detection limits of radio surveys, the range of SN kinetic energies, the measured interstellar medium (ISM) and stellar mass distribution in the host galaxy from multi-wavelength images and the current understanding of electron acceleration and magnetic field amplification in SNR shocks from first-principle kinetic simulations. Applying our model to the SNR population in M33, we reproduce the SNR radio luminosity function with a median SN rate of {\tilde}3.1 {\times} 10$^{-3}$ per year and an electron acceleration efficiency, {$\epsilon$}$_{e}$ {\tilde} 4.2 {\times} 10$^{-3}$. We predict that the radio visibility times of {\tilde}70 per cent of M33 SNRs will be determined by their Sedov-Taylor lifetimes, and correlated with the measured ISM column density, N$_{H}$ (t\_$\{$vis$\}$ {\prop} N\_H\^{}$\{$-a$\}$, with a {\tilde} 0.33) while the remaining will have visibility times determined by the detection limit of the radio survey. These observational constraints on the visibility time of SNRs will allow us to use SNR catalogues as `SN surveys' to calculate SN rates and delay-time distributions in the Local Group.},

	Abstract = {The presumed Wolf-Rayet star progenitors of Type Ib/c supernovae have fast, low-density winds, and the shock waves generated by the supernova interaction with the wind are not expected to be radiative at typical times of observation. The injected energy spectrum of radio-emitting electrons typically has an observed index p=3, which is suggestive of acceleration in cosmic-ray-dominated shocks. The early, absorbed part of the radio light curves can be attributed to synchrotron self-absorption, which leads to constraints on the magnetic field in the emitting region and on the circumstellar density. The range of circumstellar densities inferred from the radio emission is somewhat broader than that for Galactic Wolf-Rayet stars, if similar efficiencies of synchrotron emission are assumed in the extragalactic supernovae. For the observed and expected ranges of circumstellar densities to roughly overlap, a high efficiency of magnetic field production in the shocked region is required ({$\epsilon$}$_{B}$\~{}0.1). For the expected densities around a Wolf-Rayet star, a nonthermal mechanism is generally required to explain the observed X-ray luminosities of Type Ib/c supernovae. Inverse Compton emission is a candidate for the emission, if the observations are near optical maximum. In other cases we suggest that the mechanism is X-ray synchrotron emission in a situation in which the shock wave is cosmic-ray-dominated so that the electron energy spectrum flattens at high energy. More comprehensive X-ray observations of a Type Ib/c supernova are needed to determine whether this suggestion is correct.},

	Abstract = {Most Type II supernovae probably have red supergiant progenitor stars which are expected to have slow, dense winds; multiwavelength observations of some Type II supernovae show evidence for interaction of the supernova with the wind. Recent optical spectroscopy of some normal supernovae at ages of about 10 yr or more has shown emission lines such as H alpha (O I), and (O III). We investigate the circumstellar interaction model for this emission, beginning with the hydrodynamics of the interaction. An early cooling phase is expected at the reverse shock front and the dense shell that it is built up can play a dominant role in the absorption of X-rays produced at the shock front. A steep supernova density gradient gives rise to a relatively slow reverse shock front and the reverse shock emission is at far-ultraviolet wavelengths. This radiation field produces a highly ionized region in this supernova ejecta with a sharp boundary. The reverse shock has higher temperatures for a flatter supernova density profile and gives an X-ray-dominated spectrum. In this case, there is a heated broad inner region in the supernova ejecta with low ionization. In both cases, radiation from the shock front can be absorbed by the shell formed by radiative cooling, giving rise to a low-ionization spectrum. Thus, high-ionization lines are formed in the freely expanding supernova ejecta, while low-ionization lines are formed both in the ejecta and in the shocked shell. We compare the models to observations of SN 1980K and SN 1979C up to an age of 10 yr and find that the models with a relatively flat power law profile and X-ray heating show good agreement with the strongest optical lines. The models predict an increase of the (O III) H alpha ratio at late times because of a decrease in collisional deexcitaion of the (O III); such a large ratio has been recently observed in SN 1957D. We also make predictions of the strongest ultraviolet and infrared lines to be expected from circumstellar interaction.},

	Abstract = {Type Ia supernovae (SNe) are presumed to arise from white dwarf progenitors, which may not appreciably modify their ambient medium. We study the interaction of the resulting supernova remnants with a constant density interstellar medium. Density profiles obtained from detailed explosion models of Type Ia SN explosions can be complex, but an exponential profile gives the best approximate representation of a set of profiles, and we emphasize this case. We describe the time evolution of dynamical quantities (such as radius, velocity, and expansion parameter) as a result of the interaction in terms of dimensionless variables and present the profiles of physical quantities. We compare our results to the power-law and constant ejecta density cases; a characteristic feature of the exponential case is that the shocked ejecta have a relatively constant temperature. The effect of a possible circumstellar wind region close to the supernova is to create a dense, cool shell near the contact discontinuity between the shocked ejecta and the surrounding medium. The complex density structure found in some supernova models persists in the shocked layer, giving rise to density and temperature variations. We apply our results to the two likely historical Type Ia SNe, SN 1006 and Tycho. The observed angular sizes and expansion rates are consistent with a distance of 1.95 +/- 0.4 kpc and an ambient H density of 0.05-0.1 cm$^{-3}$ for SN 1006. For Tycho's SNR, the results are not conclusive but indicate a distance around 2.3 kpc for an ambient density of 0.6-1.1 cm$^{-3}$. In both cases, the low expansion rate limits the extent of a possible circumstellar wind region. The evidence for temperature variations in the ejecta of Tycho's remnant suggests that the supernova profile was more complex than an exponential profile and contained density inhomogeneities, or that there was early interaction with a circumstellar wind.},

	Abstract = {We examine the relation between presupernova stellar structure and the distribution of ejecta in core-collapse supernovae of Types Ib, Ic, and II, under the approximations of adiabatic, spherically symmetric flow. We develop a simple yet accurate analytical formula for the velocity of the initial forward shock that traverses the stellar envelope. For material that does not later experience a strong reverse shock, the entropy deposited by this forward shock persists into the final, freely expanding state. We demonstrate that the final density distribution can be approximated with simple models for the final pressure distribution, in a way that matches the results of simulations. Our results indicate that the distribution of density and radiation pressure in a star's ejecta depends on whether the outer envelope is radiative or convective, and if convective, on the composition structure of the star. Our models are most accurate for the high-velocity ejecta cast away from the periphery of a star. For stellar structures that limit to a common form in this region, the resulting ejecta limit to a common distribution at high velocities because the blast wave forgets its history as it approaches the stellar surface. We present formulae for the final density distribution of this material as a function of mass, for both radiative and efficiently convective envelopes. These formulae limit to the well-known planar, self-similar solutions for mass shells approaching the stellar surface. However, the assumption of adiabatic flow breaks down for shells of low optical depth, so this planar limit need not be attained. The event of shock emergence, which limits adiabatic flow, also produces a soft X-ray burst of radiation. Formulae are given for the observable properties of this burst and their dependence on the parameters of the explosion. Motivated by the relativistic expansion recently inferred by Kulkarni et al. for the synchrotron shell around SN 1998bw, we estimate the criterion for relativistic mass ejection and the rest mass of relativistic ejecta. We base our models for the entire ejecta distribution on the high-velocity solution, on our shock-velocity formula, and on realistic radiation pressure distributions. We also present simpler, but less flexible, analytical approximations for ejecta distributions. We survey the ejecta of the polytropic hydrogen envelopes of red supergiants. Our models will be useful for studies of the light curves and circumstellar or interstellar interactions of core-collapse supernovae, and of the birth of pulsar nebulae in their ejecta.},

	Abstract = {Mass loss from massive stars ($\gt$\~{}8 M$_{solar}$) can result in the formation of circumstellar wind-blown cavities surrounding the star, bordered by a thin, dense, cold shell. When the star explodes as a core-collapse supernova (SN), the resulting shock wave will interact with this modified medium around the star, rather than the interstellar medium. In this work we first explore the nature of the circumstellar medium around massive stars in various evolutionary stages. This is followed by a study of the evolution of SNe within these wind-blown bubbles. The evolution depends primarily on a single parameter {$\Lambda$}, the ratio of the mass of the dense shell to that of the ejected material. We investigate the evolution for different values of this parameter. We also plot approximate X-ray surface brightness plots from the simulations. For very small values {$\Lambda$}$\lt$$\lt$1 the effect of the shell is negligible, as one would expect. Values of {$\Lambda$}$\lt$\~{}1 affect the SN evolution, but the SN ``forgets'' about the existence of the shell in about 10 doubling times or so. The remnant density profile changes, and consequently the X-ray emission from the remnant will also change. The initial X-ray luminosity of the remnant is quite low, but interaction of the shock wave with the dense circumstellar shell can increase the luminosity by 2-3 orders of magnitude. As the reflected shock begins to move inward, X-ray images will show the presence of a double-shelled structure. Larger values result in more SN energy being expended to the shell. The resulting reflected shock moves quickly back to the origin, and the ejecta are thermalized rapidly. The evolution of the remnant is speeded up, and the entire remnant may appear bright in X-rays. If {$\Lambda$}$\gt$$\gt$1, then a substantial amount of energy may be expended in the shell. In the extreme case the SN may go directly from the free expansion to the adiabatic stage, bypassing the Sedov stage. Our results show that in many cases the SNR spends a significant amount of time within the bubble. The low density within the bubble can delay the onset of the Sedov stage and may end up reducing the amount of time spent in the Sedov stage. The complicated density profile within the bubble makes it difficult to infer the mass-loss properties of the pre-SN star by studying the evolution of the resulting SNR.},

abstract = {We suggest that ultra-high-energy (UHE) cosmic rays (CRs) may be accelerated in ultra-relativistic flows via a one-shot mechanism, the “espresso” acceleration, in which already-energetic particles are generally boosted by a factor of ∼Γ2 in energy, where Γ is the flow Lorentz factor. More precisely, we consider blazar-like ultra-relativistic jets propagating into a halo of “seed” CRs produced in supernova remnants, which can accelerate UHECRs up to 1020 eV. Such a re-acceleration process naturally accounts for the chemical composition measured by the Pierre Auger Collaboration, which resembles the one around and above the knee in the CR spectrum, and is consistent with the distribution of potential sources in the local universe; particularly intriguing is the coincidence of the powerful blazar Mrk 421 with the hotspot reported by the Telescope Array Collaboration.}

	Abstract = {Powerful extragalactic radio sources comprise two extended regions containing magnetic field and synchrotron-emitting relativistic electrons, each linked by a jet to a central compact radio source located in the nucleus of the associated galaxy. These jets are collimated streams of plasma that emerge from the nucleus in opposite directions, along which flow mass, momentum, energy, and magnetic flux. Methods of using the observations diagnostically to infer the pressures, densities, and fluid velocities within jets are explained. The jets terminate in the extended radio components, where they interact strongly with the surrounding medium through a combination of shock waves and instabilities. Jets may expand freely, be confined by external gas pressure, or be pinched by toroidal magnetic fields. Shear flows are known to be Kelvin-Helmholtz unstable and thus may be responsible for some of the observed oscillation of jets about their mean directions and for creating the turbulence and shock waves needed to accelerate the relativistic electrons. Larger-scale bending may be caused by changes in the jet axis within the nucleus, gravitational interaction of the radio galaxy with a companion galaxy, or rapid motion of the source through dense intergalactic gas. The compact radio sources also exhibit a jet morphology and contain more direct clues as to the origins of jets; in particular, the variations sometimes observed imply bulk flows that are relativistic. It is widely believed that nuclear activity is ultimately ascribable to gas accreting onto a massive black hole. The accretion can proceed in several different fashions, depending upon whether or not the gas has angular momentum and whether or not the radiation emitted is sufficiently intense to influence the dynamics of the flow. Several distinct mechanisms for jet production in the context of black holes have been proposed. (Alternative mechanisms involving dense star clusters and massive spinning stars are also reviewed.) Supersonic jets may be collimated along the spin axis of a gas cloud surrounding the source of the lighter jet gas. Magnetic fields may be crucial in collimating jets, especially if they are wrapped around the jet by orbiting gas and can thereby collimate the outflow through the pinch effect. In fact, the spin energy of the black hole could also be extracted by magnetic torques, in which case the jet would contain electrons and positrons and carry a large electromagnetic Poynting flux. Statistical investigations of active galaxies also furnish valuable information on their nature and evolutionary behavior. The formation of particular kinds of sources appears to be correlated with environmental effects and cosmic epoch. In addition, the brightest compact radio sources on the sky, which probably involve relativistic motion, may be intrinsically faint objects beamed in our direction. There is now compelling evidence for the continuous fueling of extragalactic radio sources through jets emerging from the nucleus of the associated galaxy. The morphological classification of radio sources is interpreted in terms of the powers, speeds, and surroundings of jets. The ratio of the mass accretion rate to the mass of the hole may determine whether an active nucleus will be primarily a thermal object like an optical quasar or a nonthermal object like a radio galaxy. The authors outline a unified model of nuclear activity and assess what future progress may stem from observational developments (especially the proposed very long baseline array), experimental approaches (such as wind tunnel simulations), and theoretical studies (in particular, large-scale numerical hydrodynamical computing).},

We construct, for the first time, its overall spectral energy distribution (SED) which appears to be intriguingly similar to those of blazars, showing two broad peaks located in the far-infrared band and at \~{}0.1MeV respectively. The whole nuclear emission of Centaurus A is successfully reproduced with a synchrotron self-Compton model. The estimated physical parameters of the emitting source are similar to those of BL Lacs, except for a much smaller beaming factor, as qualitatively expected when a relativistic jet is orientated at a large angle to the line of sight. These results represent strong evidence that Centaurus A is indeed a misoriented BL Lac, and provide strong support in favour of the unification scheme for low-luminosity radio-loud active galactic nuclei. Modelling of the SED of Centaurus A also provides further and independent indications of the presence of velocity structures in sub-parsec-scale jets.},

	Abstract = {TeV BL Lacertae objects require extreme relativistic bulk motions in the gamma-ray emission region, but at the VLBI scale their radio knots hardly move. The same sources show evidence, in radio, of a structure made of a fast spine plus a slow layer. We propose that this structure exists even on the spatial scale of regions responsible for the gamma-ray emission. One component sees the (beamed) radiation produced by the other, and this enhances the inverse Compton emission of both components. In addition, this allows the magnetic field to be nearly in equipartition with the emitting particles. The inverse Compton emission of the spine is anisotropic in its frame, possibly producing a deceleration of the spine by the Compton rocket effect. In this scenario, the slow layer is also a relatively strong high-energy emitter, and thus radiogalaxies become potentially detectable by GLAST.},

	Abstract = {A new analysis of the data set from the Pierre Auger Observatory provides evidence for anisotropy in the arrival directions of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays on an intermediate angular scale, which is indicative of excess arrivals from strong, nearby sources. The data consist of 5514 events above 20 $\{$EeV$\}$ with zenith angles up to 80{\deg} recorded before 2017 April 30. Sky models have been created for two distinct populations of extragalactic gamma-ray emitters: active galactic nuclei from the second catalog of hard Fermi-LAT sources (2FHL) and starburst galaxies from a sample that was examined with Fermi-LAT. Flux-limited samples, which include all types of galaxies from the Swift-BAT and 2MASS surveys, have been investigated for comparison. The sky model of cosmic-ray density constructed using each catalog has two free parameters, the fraction of events correlating with astrophysical objects, and an angular scale characterizing the clustering of cosmic rays around extragalactic sources. A maximum-likelihood ratio test is used to evaluate the best values of these parameters and to quantify the strength of each model by contrast with isotropy. It is found that the starburst model fits the data better than the hypothesis of isotropy with a statistical significance of 4.0{$\sigma$}, the highest value of the test statistic being for energies above 39 $\{$EeV$\}$. The three alternative models are favored against isotropy with 2.7{$\sigma$}-3.2{$\sigma$} significance. The origin of the indicated deviation from isotropy is examined and prospects for more sensitive future studies are discussed.  Any correspondence should be addressed to .},

For the energy bins [4, 8] EeV and E {\ge} 8 EeV, the most significant signal is a dipolar modulation in R.A. at energies above 8 EeV, as previously reported. In this paper we further scrutinize the highest-energy bin by splitting it into three energy ranges. We find that the amplitude of the dipole increases with energy above 4 EeV. The growth can be fitted with a power law with index {$\beta$} = 0.79 {\plusmn} 0.19. The directions of the dipoles are consistent with an extragalactic origin of these anisotropies at all the energies considered. Additionally, we have estimated the quadrupolar components of the anisotropy: they are not statistically significant.

Assuming a constant cosmic-ray acceleration efficiency by supernova remnants with Milky Way parameters, we calculate the cosmic-ray proton and primary and secondary electron/positron populations, predict the radio and {$\gamma$}-ray spectra, and compare with published measurements. We find that our models easily fit the observed {$\gamma$}-ray spectrum for NGC 253 while constraining the cosmic-ray source spectral index and acceleration efficiency. However, we encountered difficultly modeling the observed radio data and constraining the speed of the galactic wind and the magnetic field strength, unless the gas mass is less than currently preferred values. Additionally, our starburst model consistently underestimates the observed {$\gamma$}-ray flux and overestimates the radio flux for NGC 1068 these issues would be resolved if the AGN is the primary source of {$\gamma$}-rays.

As the cosmic ray protons collide with the interstellar medium, they produce secondary electrons that are also contained within the system and radiate synchrotron emission. Using results from {$\chi$}$^{2}$ tests between the model and the observed radio spectral energy distribution, we predict the emergent {$\gamma$}-ray and high-energy neutrino spectra and find the magnetic field to be at milligauss levels.

	Abstract = {Electron acceleration to non-thermal energies in low Mach number (M$_{s}$ $\lt$\~{} 5) shocks is revealed by radio and X-ray observations of galaxy clusters and solar flares, but the electron acceleration mechanism remains poorly understood. Diffusive shock acceleration, also known as first-order Fermi acceleration, cannot be directly invoked to explain the acceleration of electrons. Rather, an additional mechanism is required to pre-accelerate the electrons from thermal to supra-thermal energies, so they can then participate in the Fermi process. In this work, we use two- and three-dimensional particle-in-cell plasma simulations to study electron acceleration in low Mach number shocks. We focus on the particle energy spectra and the acceleration mechanism in a reference run with M$_{s}$ = 3 and a quasi-perpendicular pre-shock magnetic field. We find that about 15\% of the electrons can be efficiently accelerated, forming a non-thermal power-law tail in the energy spectrum with a slope of p \~{}= 2.4. Initially, thermal electrons are energized at the shock front via shock drift acceleration (SDA). The accelerated electrons are then reflected back upstream where their interaction with the incoming flow generates magnetic waves. In turn, the waves scatter the electrons propagating upstream back toward the shock for further energization via SDA. In summary, the self-generated waves allow for repeated cycles of SDA, similarly to a sustained Fermi-like process. This mechanism offers a natural solution to the conflict between the bright radio synchrotron emission observed from the outskirts of galaxy clusters and the low electron acceleration efficiency usually expected in low Mach number shocks.},

	Abstract = {Electron acceleration to non-thermal energies is known to occur in low Mach number (M$_{s}$ $\lt$\~{} 5) shocks in galaxy clusters and solar flares, but the electron acceleration mechanism remains poorly understood. Using two-dimensional (2D) particle-in-cell (PIC) plasma simulations, we showed in Paper I that electrons are efficiently accelerated in low Mach number (M$_{s}$ = 3) quasi-perpendicular shocks via a Fermi-like process. The electrons bounce between the upstream region and the shock front, with each reflection at the shock resulting in energy gain via shock drift acceleration. The upstream scattering is provided by oblique magnetic waves that are self-generated by the electrons escaping ahead of the shock. In the present work, we employ additional 2D PIC simulations to address the nature of the upstream oblique waves. We find that the waves are generated by the shock-reflected electrons via the firehose instability, which is driven by an anisotropy in the electron velocity distribution. We systematically explore how the efficiency of wave generation and of electron acceleration depend on the magnetic field obliquity, the flow magnetization (or equivalently, the plasma beta), and the upstream electron temperature. We find that the mechanism works for shocks with high plasma beta (gsim 20) at nearly all magnetic field obliquities, and for electron temperatures in the range relevant for galaxy clusters. Our findings offer a natural solution to the conflict between the bright radio synchrotron emission observed from the outskirts of galaxy clusters and the low electron acceleration efficiency usually expected in low Mach number shocks.},

	Abstract = {We study particle acceleration and magnetic field amplification in the primary hotspot in the north-west jet of radiogalaxy Cygnus A. By using the observed flux density at 43 GHz in a well-resolved region of this hotspot, we determine the minimum value of the jet density and constrain the magnitude of the magnetic field. We find that a jet with density greater than 5 {\times} 10$^{-5}$ cm$^{-3}$ and hotspot magnetic field in the range 50-400 {$\mu$}G are required to explain the synchrotron emission at 43 GHz. The upper-energy cut-off in the hotspot synchrotron spectrum is at a frequency {\lsim}5 {\times} 10$^{14}$ Hz, indicating that the maximum energy of non-thermal electrons accelerated at the jet reverse shock is E$_{e, max}$ {\sim} 0.8 TeV in a magnetic field of 100 {$\mu$}G. Based on the condition that the magnetic-turbulence scalelength has to be larger than the plasma skin depth, and that the energy density in non-thermal particles cannot violate the limit imposed by the jet kinetic luminosity, we show that E$_{e, max}$ cannot be constrained by synchrotron losses as traditionally assumed. In addition to that, and assuming that the shock is quasi-perpendicular, we show that non-resonant hybrid instabilities generated by the streaming of cosmic rays with energy E$_{e, max}$ can grow fast enough to amplify the jet magnetic field up to 50-400 {$\mu$}G and accelerate particles up to the maximum energy E$_{e, max}$ observed in the Cygnus A primary hotspot.},

	Abstract = {The origin of ultrahigh energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) has been an open question for decades. Here, we use a combination of hydrodynamic simulations and general physical arguments to demonstrate that UHECRs can in principle be produced by diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) in shocks in the backflowing material of radio galaxy lobes. These shocks occur after the jet material has passed through the relativistic termination shock. Recently, several authors have demonstrated that highly relativistic shocks are not effective in accelerating UHECRs. The shocks in our proposed model have a range of non-relativistic or mildly relativistic shock velocities more conducive to UHECR acceleration, with shock sizes in the range 1-10 kpc. Approximately 10 per cent of jet's energy flux is focused through a shock in the backflow of M $\gt$ 3. Although the shock velocities can be low enough that acceleration to high energy via DSA is still efficient, they are also high enough for the Hillas energy to approach 10$^{19-20}$ eV, particularly for heavier CR composition and in cases where fluid elements pass through multiple shocks. We discuss some of the more general considerations for acceleration of particles to ultrahigh energy with reference to giant-lobed radio galaxies such as Centaurus A and Fornax A, a class of sources which may be responsible for the observed anisotropies from UHECR observatories.},

	Abstract = {A new analysis of the data set from the Pierre Auger Observatory provides evidence for anisotropy in the arrival directions of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays on an intermediate angular scale, which is indicative of excess arrivals from strong, nearby sources. The data consist of 5514 events above 20 $\{$EeV$\}$ with zenith angles up to 80{\deg} recorded before 2017 April 30. Sky models have been created for two distinct populations of extragalactic gamma-ray emitters: active galactic nuclei from the second catalog of hard Fermi-LAT sources (2FHL) and starburst galaxies from a sample that was examined with Fermi-LAT. Flux-limited samples, which include all types of galaxies from the Swift-BAT and 2MASS surveys, have been investigated for comparison. The sky model of cosmic-ray density constructed using each catalog has two free parameters, the fraction of events correlating with astrophysical objects, and an angular scale characterizing the clustering of cosmic rays around extragalactic sources. A maximum-likelihood ratio test is used to evaluate the best values of these parameters and to quantify the strength of each model by contrast with isotropy. It is found that the starburst model fits the data better than the hypothesis of isotropy with a statistical significance of 4.0{$\sigma$}, the highest value of the test statistic being for energies above 39 $\{$EeV$\}$. The three alternative models are favored against isotropy with 2.7{$\sigma$}-3.2{$\sigma$} significance. The origin of the indicated deviation from isotropy is examined and prospects for more sensitive future studies are discussed.  Any correspondence should be addressed to .},

	Abstract = {We present a detailed study of the large-scale anisotropies of cosmic rays with energies above 4 EeV measured using the Pierre Auger Observatory. For the energy bins [4, 8] EeV and E {\ge} 8 EeV, the most significant signal is a dipolar modulation in R.A. at energies above 8 EeV, as previously reported. In this paper we further scrutinize the highest-energy bin by splitting it into three energy ranges. We find that the amplitude of the dipole increases with energy above 4 EeV. The growth can be fitted with a power law with index {$\beta$} = 0.79 {\plusmn} 0.19. The directions of the dipoles are consistent with an extragalactic origin of these anisotropies at all the energies considered. Additionally, we have estimated the quadrupolar components of the anisotropy: they are not statistically significant. We discuss the results in the context of the predictions from different models for the distribution of ultrahigh-energy sources and cosmic magnetic fields.},

	Abstract = {Cosmic rays are high-energy particles arriving from space; some have energies far beyond those that human-made particle accelerators can achieve. The sources of higher-energy cosmic rays remain under debate, although we know that lower-energy cosmic rays come from the solar wind. The Pierre Auger Collaboration reports the observation of thousands of cosmic rays with ultrahigh energies of several exa-electron volts (about a Joule per particle), arriving in a slightly dipolar distribution (see the Perspective by Gallagher and Halzen). The direction of the rays indicates that the particles originated in other galaxies and not from nearby sources within our own Milky Way Galaxy.},

The sample is composed of 929 AGN (382 Type-1 AGN and 547 Type-2 AGN) and it covers a wide range of redshifts, X-ray luminosities and absorbing column densities. About 65 per cent of the sources are spectroscopically identified as either Type-1 or Type-2 AGN (83 and 52 per cent, respectively), while accurate photometric redshifts are available for the rest of the sample. The study of such a large sample of X-ray selected AGN with a high-quality multiwavelength coverage from the far-infrared (now with the inclusion of Herschel data at 100 and 160 {$\mu$}m) to the optical-ultraviolet allows us to obtain accurate estimates of bolometric luminosities, bolometric corrections and Eddington ratios. The k$_{bol}$ - L$_{bol}$ relations derived in this work are calibrated for the first time against a sizable AGN sample, and rely on observed redshifts, X-ray luminosities and column density distributions. We find that k$_{bol}$ is significantly lower at high L$_{bol}$ with respect to previous estimates by Marconi et al. and Hopkins et al. Black hole (BH) masses and Eddington ratios are available for 170 Type-1 AGN, while BH masses for Type-2 AGN are computed for 481 objects using the BH mass-stellar mass relation and the morphological information. We confirm a trend between k$_{bol}$ and {$\lambda$}$_{Edd}$, with lower hard X-ray bolometric corrections at lower Eddington ratios for both Type-1 and Type-2 AGN. We find that, on average, the Eddington ratio increases with redshift for all types of AGN at any given M$_{BH}$, while no clear evolution with redshift is seen at any given L$_{bol}$.},

	Abstract = {Black hole mass, along with mass accretion rate, is a fundamental property of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Black hole mass sets an approximate upper limit to AGN energetics via the Eddington limit. We collect and compare all AGN black hole mass estimates from the literature; these 177 masses are mostly based on the virial assumption for the broad emission lines, with the broad-line region size determined from either reverberation mapping or optical luminosity. We introduce 200 additional black hole mass estimates based on properties of the host galaxy bulges, using either the observed stellar velocity dispersion or the fundamental plane relation to infer {$\sigma$} these methods assume that AGN hosts are normal galaxies. We compare 36 cases for which black hole mass has been generated by different methods and find, for individual objects, a scatter as high as a couple of orders of magnitude. The less direct the method, the larger the discrepancy with other estimates, probably due to the large scatter in the underlying correlations assumed. Using published fluxes, we calculate bolometric luminosities for 234 AGNs and investigate the relation between black hole mass and luminosity. In contrast to other studies, we find no significant correlation of black hole mass with luminosity, other than those induced by circular reasoning in the estimation of black hole mass. The Eddington limit defines an approximate upper envelope to the distribution of luminosities, but the lower envelope depends entirely on the sample of AGNs included. For any given black hole mass, there is a range in Eddington ratio of up to 3 orders of magnitude.},

	Annote = {The balloon-borne Cosmic Ray Energetics And Mass experiment launched five times from Antarctica has achieved a cumulative flight duration of about 156 days above 99.5% of the atmosphere. The instrument is configured with complementary and redundant particle detectors designed to extend direct measurements of cosmic-ray composition to the highest energies practical with balloon flights. All elements from protons to iron nuclei are separated with excellent charge resolution. Here, we report results from the first two flights of ?70 days, which indicate hardening of the elemental spectra above ?200 GeV/nucleon and a spectral difference between the two most abundant species, protons and helium nuclei. These results challenge the view that cosmic-ray spectra are simple power laws below the so-called knee at ?1015 eV. This discrepant hardening may result from a relatively nearby source, or it could represent spectral concavity caused by interactions of cosmic rays with the accelerating shock. Other possible explanations should also be investigated.},

	Abstract = {We present a new method for probing the hadronic interaction models at ultrahigh energy and extracting details about mass composition. This is done using the time profiles of the signals recorded with the water-Cherenkov detectors of the Pierre Auger Observatory. The profiles arise from a mix of the muon and electromagnetic components of air showers. Using the risetimes of the recorded signals, we define a new parameter, which we use to compare our observations with predictions from simulations. We find, first, inconsistencies between our data and predictions over a greater energy range and with substantially more events than in previous studies. Second, by calibrating the new parameter with fluorescence measurements from observations made at the Auger Observatory, we can infer the depth of shower maximum X$_{max}$ for a sample of over 81,000 events extending from 0.3 to over 100 EeV. Above 30 EeV, the sample is nearly 14 times larger than what is currently available from fluorescence measurements and extending the covered energy range by half a decade. The energy dependence of {\mlab}X$_{max}${\mrab} is compared to simulations and interpreted in terms of the mean of the logarithmic mass. We find good agreement with previous work and extend the measurement of the mean depth of shower maximum to greater energies than before, reducing significantly the statistical uncertainty associated with the inferences about mass composition.},

	Abstract = {We present a new method for probing the hadronic interaction models at ultrahigh energy and extracting details about mass composition. This is done using the time profiles of the signals recorded with the water-Cherenkov detectors of the Pierre Auger Observatory. The profiles arise from a mix of the muon and electromagnetic components of air showers. Using the risetimes of the recorded signals, we define a new parameter, which we use to compare our observations with predictions from simulations. We find, first, inconsistencies between our data and predictions over a greater energy range and with substantially more events than in previous studies. Second, by calibrating the new parameter with fluorescence measurements from observations made at the Auger Observatory, we can infer the depth of shower maximum X$_{max}$ for a sample of over 81,000 events extending from 0.3 to over 100 EeV. Above 30 EeV, the sample is nearly 14 times larger than what is currently available from fluorescence measurements and extending the covered energy range by half a decade. The energy dependence of {\mlab}X$_{max}${\mrab} is compared to simulations and interpreted in terms of the mean of the logarithmic mass. We find good agreement with previous work and extend the measurement of the mean depth of shower maximum to greater energies than before, reducing significantly the statistical uncertainty associated with the inferences about mass composition.},

	Abstract = {Physicists have pondered the origin of cosmic rays for over a hundred years. However the last few years have seen an upsurge in the observation, progress in the theory and a genuine increase in the importance attached to the topic due to its intimate connection to the indirect detection of evidence for dark matter. The intent of this talk is to set the stage for the meeting by reviewing some of the basic features of the entire cosmic ray spectrum from GeV to ZeV energy and some of the models that have been developed. The connection will also be made to recent developments in understanding general astrophysical particle acceleration in pulsar wind nebulae, relativistic jets and gamma ray bursts. The prospects for future discoveries, which may elucidate the origin of cosmic rays, are bright.},

	Abstract = {We formulate the general requirements, set by classical electrodynamics, on the sources of extremely high-energy cosmic rays (EHECRs). It is shown that the parameters of EHECR accelerators are strongly limited not only by the particle confinement in large-scale magnetic fields or by the difference in electric potentials (generalized Hillas criterion) but also by the synchrotron radiation, the electro-bremsstrahlung, or the curvature radiation of accelerated particles. Optimization of these requirements in terms of an accelerator's size and magnetic field strength results in the ultimate lower limit to the overall source energy budget, which scales as the fifth power of attainable particle energy. Hard {$\gamma$} rays accompanying generation of EHECRs can be used to probe potential acceleration sites. We apply the results to several populations of astrophysical objects-potential EHECR sources-and discuss their ability to accelerate protons to 10$^{20}$ eV and beyond. The possibility of gain from ultrarelativistic bulk flows is addressed, with active galactic nuclei and gamma-ray bursts being the examples.},

@article{rossi+08,
	Abstract = {Context: Strong observational evidence indicates that all extragalactic jets associated with AGNs move at relativistic speed up to 100 pc$^{-1}$ kpc scales from the nucleus. At greater distances, reflecting the Fanaroff-Riley radio source classification, we observe an abrupt deceleration in FR-I jets while relativistic motions persist up to Mpc scale in FR-II. Moreover, VLBI observations of some object such as B2 1144+35, Mrk501 and M87 show limb brightening of the jet radio emission on the parsec scale. This effect is interpreted kinematically as due to the deboosted central spine at high Lorentz factor and of a weakly relativistic external layer.   <BR />Aims: In this paper we investigate whether these effects can be interpreted by a braking of the collimated flow by external medium entrainment favored by shear instabilities, namely Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities. We examine in details the physical conditions under which significant deceleration of a relativistic flow is produced.  <BR />Methods: We investigated the phenomenon by means of high-resolution three-dimensional relativistic hydrodynamic simulations using the PLUTO code for computational astrophysics. <BR />Results: We find that the most important parameter in determining the instability evolution and the entrainment properties is the ambient/jet density contrast. We show that lighter jets suffer stronger slowing down in the external layer than in the central part and conserve a central spine with a high Lorentz factor.  <BR />Conclusions: Our model is verified by constructing synthetic emission maps from the numerical simulations which compare reasonably well with VLBI observations of the inner part of FR-I sources.},

@article{amato+17,
	Abstract = {The physics of energetic particle propagation in magnetized environments plays a crucial role in both the processes of acceleration and transport of cosmic rays. Recent theoretical developments in the field of cosmic ray research have been mainly in the direction of exploring non-linear aspects of the processes in which these particles are involved, namely the action of cosmic rays on the environment in which the transport and/or acceleration take place. When cosmic rays propagate outside of the acceleration region, such action is mainly in two forms: (1) they generate hydromagnetic waves, through streaming instabilities, leading to a dependence of the scattering properties of the medium on the spectrum and spatial distribution of the energetic particles, and (2) they exert a dynamical action on the plasma, which may cause the launching of cosmic ray driven Galactic winds. In this article we discuss these and other recent developments and how they compare with the bulk of new observations on the spectra of primary nuclei (mainly H and He) and secondary to primary ratios, such as the B/C ratio and the p��/p ratio, and the positrons ratio e+/(e-+e+). We also comment on some radically new models of the origin of CRs, in which the physical meaning of the secondary to primary ratios is not the same as in the standard model.},

	Abstract = {We study the production of cosmic rays (CRs) in supernova remnants (SNRs), including the production of electron and positron CR components. This combines for the first time nuclear collisions inside CR sources and in the diffuse interstellar medium leading to the creation of electrons and positrons, as well as their reacceleration, with the injection and subsequent acceleration of suprathermal protons and electrons from the postshock thermal pool. Selfconsistent CR spectra are calculated on the basis of the nonlinear kinetic model. It is shown that reacceleration of positrons created in SNR and ISM produces a considerable effect at energies above 10 GeV, making its energy spectrum substantially flatter than the spectrum created in ISM. Calculated electron and positron spectra are in the satisfactory agreement with the existing measurements.},

We show that although these instabilities have been discussed primarily in the context of supernova-driven interstellar shocks, they can also operate in the intergalactic medium and in galaxies with weak magnetic fields, where, as a strong source of helical magnetic fluctuations, they could contribute to the overall evolution of the magnetic field. Within the Milky Way, these instabilities are strongest in warm ionized gas and appear to be weak in hot, low density gas unless the injection efficiency of cosmic rays is very high.},

	Abstract = {Neutrinos interact only very weakly with matter, but giant detectors have succeeded in detecting small numbers of astrophysical neutrinos. Aside from a diffuse background, only two individual sources have been identified: the Sun and a nearby supernova in 1987. A multiteam collaboration detected a high-energy neutrino event whose arrival direction was consistent with a known blazar{\textemdash}a type of quasar with a relativistic jet oriented directly along our line of sight. The blazar, TXS 0506+056, was found to be undergoing a gamma-ray flare, prompting an extensive multiwavelength campaign. Motivated by this discovery, the IceCube collaboration examined lower-energy neutrinos detected over the previous several years, finding an excess emission at the location of the blazar. Thus, blazars are a source of astrophysical neutrinos.Science, this issue p. 147, p. eaat1378A high-energy neutrino event detected by IceCube on 22 September 2017 was coincident in direction and time with a gamma-ray flare from the blazar TXS 0506+056. Prompted by this association, we investigated 9.5 years of IceCube neutrino observations to search for excess emission at the position of the blazar. We found an excess of high-energy neutrino events, with respect to atmospheric backgrounds, at that position between September 2014 and March 2015. Allowing for time-variable flux, this constitutes 3. � evidence for neutrino emission from the direction of TXS 0506+056, independent of and prior to the 2017 flaring episode. This suggests that blazars are identifiable sources of the high-energy astrophysical neutrino flux.},

@article{squire+17,
	Abstract = {Using two-dimensional hybrid-kinetic simulations, we explore the nonlinear ``interruption'' of standing and traveling shear-Alfv{\'e}n waves in collisionless plasmas. Interruption involves a self-generated pressure anisotropy removing the restoring force of a linearly polarized Alfv{\'e}nic perturbation, and occurs for wave amplitudes {$\delta$} B$_{⊥}$/B$_{0}${\gsim}{$\beta$}$^{-1 /2}$ (where {$\beta$} is the ratio of thermal to magnetic pressure). We use highly elongated domains to obtain maximal scale separation between the wave and the ion gyroscale. For standing waves above the amplitude limit, we find that the large-scale magnetic field of the wave decays rapidly. The dynamics are strongly affected by the excitation of oblique firehose modes, which transition into long-lived parallel fluctuations at the ion gyroscale and cause significant particle scattering. Traveling waves are damped more slowly, but are also influenced by small-scale parallel fluctuations created by the decay of firehose modes. Our results demonstrate that collisionless plasmas cannot support linearly polarized Alfv{\'e}n waves above {$\delta$} B$_{⊥}$/B$_{0}${\tilde}{$\beta$}$^{-1 /2}$. They also provide a vivid illustration of two key aspects of low-collisionality plasma dynamics: (i) the importance of velocity-space instabilities in regulating plasma dynamics at high {$\beta$} , and (ii) how nonlinear collisionless processes can transfer mechanical energy directly from the largest scales into thermal energy and microscale fluctuations, without the need for a scale-by-scale turbulent cascade.},

@article{brunetti+07,
	Abstract = {We attempt to explain the non-thermal emission arising from galaxy clusters as a result of the re-acceleration of electrons by compressible turbulence induced by cluster mergers. On the basis of the available observational facts we put forward a simplified model of turbulence in clusters of galaxies focusing our attention on the compressible motions. In our model intracluster medium (ICM) is represented by a high-beta plasma in which turbulent motions are driven at large scales. The corresponding injection velocities are higher than the Alfv{\'e}n velocity. As a result, the turbulence is approximately isotropic up to the scale at which the turbulent velocity gets comparable with the Alfv{\'e}n velocity. These motions are most important for the energetic particle acceleration, but at the same time they are subjected to most of the plasma damping. Under the hypothesis that turbulence in the ICM is highly super-Alfv{\'e}nic the magnetic field is passively advected and the field lines are bended on scales smaller than that of the classical, unmagnetized, ion-ion mean free path. This affects ion diffusion and the strength of the effective viscosity. Under these conditions the bulk of turbulence in hot (5-10 keV temperature) galaxy clusters is likely to be dissipated at collisionless scales via resonant coupling with thermal and fast particles. We use collisionless physics to derive the amplitude of the different components of the energy of the compressible modes, and review and extend the treatment of plasma damping in the ICM. We calculate the acceleration of both protons and electrons taking into account both transit time damping acceleration and non-resonant acceleration by large-scale compressions. We find that relativistic electrons can be re-accelerated in the ICM up to energies of several GeV provided that the rms velocity of the compressible turbulent-eddies is is the sound speed in the ICM. We find that under typical conditions \~{}2-5 per cent of the energy flux of the cascading of compressible motions injected at large scales goes into the acceleration of fast particles and that this may explain the observed non-thermal emission from merging galaxy clusters.},

	Abstract = {The final results of processing the data from the balloon-born experiment ATIC-2 (Antarctica, 2002--2003) for the energy spectra of protons and He, C, O, Ne, Mg, Si, and Fe nuclei, the spectrum of all particles, and the mean logarithm of atomic weight of primary cosmic rays as a function of energy are presented. The final results are based on improvement of the methods used earlier, in particular, considerably increased resolution of the charge spectrum. The preliminary conclusions on the significant difference in the spectra of protons and helium nuclei (the proton spectrum is steeper) and the non-power character of the spectra of protons and heavier nuclei (flattening of carbon spectrum at energies above 10 TeV) are confirmed. A complex structure of the energy dependence of the mean logarithm of atomic weight is found.},

	Abstract = {We present data from the second flight of the superconducting magnet instrument for light isotopes (SMILI), which took place on 1991 July 24. This instrument was optimized to determine the isotopic composition of He, Li, Be, and B in the Galactic cosmic rays, up to an energy of 2 GeV amu-1. The abundances of He, Li, and B are found to be consistent with standard models of cosmic-ray propagation. Our measurement of the abundances of the beryllium isotopes suggests an enhancement of the fraction of the isotope 10Be over that found at low energy. Of 26 beryllium events, nine are found to be 10Be. Monte Carlo calculations based on this observation imply the mean lifetime of cosmic rays to be less than 6 Myr at the 97.5% confidence level.},

	Abstract = {We report on abundance measurements of 10Be, 26Al, 36Cl, and 54Mn in the Galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) using the Cosmic-Ray Isotope Spectrometer (CRIS) instrument aboard the Advanced Composition Explorer spacecraft at energies from ~70 to ~400 MeV nucleon-1. We also report an upper limit on the abundance of GCR 14C. The high statistical significance of these measurements allows the energy dependence of their relative abundances to be studied. A steady-state, leaky-box propagation model, incorporating observations of the local interstellar medium (ISM) composition and density and recent partial fragmentation cross section measurements, is used to interpret these abundances. Using this model, the individual galactic confinement times derived using data for each species are consistent with a unique confinement time value of �?esc = 15.0 � 1.6 Myr. The CRIS abundance measurements are consistent with propagation through an average ISM hydrogen number density nH = 0.34 � 0.04 H atoms cm-3. The surviving fractions, f, for each radioactive species have been calculated. From predictions of the diffusion models of Ptuskin & Soutoul, the values of f indicate an interstellar cosmic-ray diffusion coefficient of D = (3.5 � 2.0) �? 1028 cm2 s-1.},

	Abstract = {It has become clear during the last decades that the interaction between the supernova ejecta and the circumstellar medium is playing a major role both for the observational properties of the supernova and for understanding the evolution of the progenitor star leading up to the explosion. In addition, it provides an opportunity to understand the shock physics connected to both thermal and nonthermal processes, including relativistic particle acceleration, radiation processes, and the hydrodynamics of shock waves. This chapter has an emphasis on the information we can get from radio and X-ray observations, but also their connection to observations in the optical and ultraviolet. We first review the different physical processes involved in circumstellar interaction, including hydrodynamics, thermal X-ray emission, acceleration of relativistic particles, and non-emission processes in the radio and X-ray ranges. Finally, we discuss applications of these to different types of supernovae.},

	Abstract = {We present extensive radio and X-ray observations of the nearby Type Ic SN��2007gr in NGC��1058 obtained with the Very Large Array (VLA) and the Chandra X-ray Observatory and spanning 5 to 150 days after explosion. Through our detailed modeling of these data, we estimate the properties of the blast wave and the circumstellar environment. We find evidence for a freely expanding and non-relativistic explosion with an average blast wave velocity, , and a total internal energy for the radio emitting material of E �?? 2 �? 1046 erg assuming equipartition of energy between electrons and magnetic fields (�e = �B = 0.1). The temporal and spectral evolution of the radio emission points to a stellar wind-blown environment shaped by a steady progenitor mass loss rate of (wind velocity, vw = 103�??km�??s�??1). These parameters are fully consistent with those inferred for other SNe Ibc and are in line with the expectations for an ordinary, homologous SN explosion. Our results are at odds with those of Paragi et al. who recently reported evidence for a relativistic blast wave in SN��2007gr based on their claim that the radio emission was resolved away in a low signal-to-noise Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) observation. Here we show that the exotic physical scenarios required to explain the claimed relativistic velocity�??extreme departures from equipartition and/or a highly collimated outflow�??are excluded by our detailed VLA radio observations. Moreover, we present an independent analysis of the VLBI data and propose that a modest loss of phase coherence provides a more natural explanation for the apparent flux density loss which is evident on both short and long baselines. We conclude that SN��2007gr is an ordinary Type Ibc supernova.},

	Abstract = {We report the discovery and detailed monitoring of X-ray emission associated with the Type��IIb��SN��2011dh using data from the Swift and Chandra satellites, placing it among the best-studied X-ray supernovae (SNe) to date. We further present millimeter and radio data obtained with the Submillimeter Array, the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-wave Astronomy, and the Expanded Very Large Array during the first three weeks after explosion. Combining these observations with early optical photometry, we show that the panchromatic data set is well described by non-thermal synchrotron emission (radio/mm) with inverse Compton scattering (X-ray) of a thermal population of optical photons. In this scenario, the shock partition fractions deviate from equipartition by a factor, (�e/�B) �?� 30. We derive the properties of the shock wave and the circumstellar environment and find a time-averaged shock velocity of and a progenitor mass-loss rate of (for an assumed wind velocity, vw = 1000�??km�??s�??1). We show that these properties are consistent with the sub-class of Type��IIb��SNe characterized by compact progenitors (Type��cIIb) and dissimilar from those with extended progenitors (Type eIIb). Furthermore, we consider the early optical emission in the context of a cooling envelope model to estimate a progenitor radius of R* �?? 1011��cm, in line with the expectations for a Type��cIIb��SN. Together, these diagnostics are difficult to reconcile with the extended radius of the putative yellow supergiant progenitor star identified in archival Hubble Space Telescope observations, unless the stellar density profile is unusual. Finally, we searched for the high-energy shock breakout pulse using X-ray and gamma-ray observations obtained during the purported explosion date range. Based on the compact radius of the progenitor, we estimate that the shock breakout pulse was detectable with current instruments but likely missed due to their limited temporal/spatial coverage. Future all-sky missions will regularly detect shock breakout emission from compact SN progenitors enabling prompt follow-up observations with sensitive multi-wavelength facilities.},

	Abstract = {We present radio and X-ray observations of the nearby SN IIb 2013df in NGC 4414 from 10 to 250 days after the explosion. The radio emission showed a peculiar steep-to-shallow spectral evolution. We present a model in which inverse Compton cooling of synchrotron emitting electrons can account for the observed spectral and light curve evolution. A significant mass-loss rate, yr�??1 for a wind velocity of 10 km s�??1, is estimated from the detailed modeling of radio and X-ray emission, which are primarily due to synchrotron and bremsstrahlung, respectively. We show that SN 2013df is similar to SN 1993J in various ways. The shock wave speed of SN 2013df was found to be average among the radio supernovae; . We did not find any significant deviation from smooth decline in the light curve of SN 2013df. One of the main results of our self-consistent multiband modeling is the significant deviation from energy equipartition between magnetic fields and relativistic electrons behind the shock. We estimate . In general for SNe IIb, we find that the presence of bright optical cooling envelope emission is linked with free�??free radio absorption and bright thermal X-ray emission. This finding suggests that more extended progenitors, similar to that of SN 2013df, suffer from substantial mass loss in the years before the supernova.},

	Abstract = {Based largely on energy budget considerations and the observed cosmic-ray (CR) ionic composition, supernova remnant (SNR) blast waves are the most likely sources of CR ions with energies at least up to the �??knee�?? near 1015��eV. Shocks in young shell-type TeV-bright SNRs are surely producing TeV particles, but the emission could be dominated by ions producing �?0-decay emission or electrons producing inverse Compton gamma rays. Unambiguously identifying the GeV�??TeV emission process in a particular SNR will not only help pin down the origin of CRs, it will also add significantly to our understanding of the diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) mechanism and improve our understanding of supernovae and the impact SNRs have on the circumstellar medium. In this study, we investigate the Vela Jr. SNR, an example of TeV-bright non-thermal SNRs. We perform hydrodynamic simulations coupled with nonlinear DSA and non-equilibrium ionization near the forward shock to confront currently available multi-wavelength data. We find, with an analysis similar to that used earlier for SNR RX J1713.7�??3946, that self-consistently modeling the thermal X-ray line emission with the non-thermal continuum in our one-dimensional model strongly constrains the fitting parameters, and this leads convincingly to a leptonic origin for the GeV�??TeV emission for Vela Jr. This conclusion is further supported by applying additional constraints from observation, including the radial brightness profiles of the SNR shell in TeV gamma rays, and the spatial variation of the X-ray synchrotron spectral index. We will discuss implications of our models on future observations by the next-generation telescopes.},

	Abstract = {The radio emission from supernovae has been modeled as synchrotron emission from the interaction between the supernova and a presupernova stellar wind. The emission shows a late power-law decline and early rise due to a low-frequency absorption process, which, in some cases (SN 1979C and SN 1980K), is well modeled as free-free absorption by the external wind. However, the flux rises in many radio supernovae (e.g., SN 1987A and Type Ib and Type Ic supernovae) have not been sufficiently well observed to define the absorption mechanism. The assumption of synchrotron self-absorption yields an approximate radius of the emission region at the time of peak flux. If another mechanism is dominant, the radius must be even larger. The large radii implied for SN 1987A and the observed Type Ib and Type Ic supernovae make external free-free absorption unlikely, given what else is known about these systems, so that synchrotron self-absorption is the probable absorption mechanism. Synchrotron self-absorption may play a role in the radio emission from SN 1981K (type unknown) and SN 1978K (Type IIn). Model supernova light curves with synchrotron self-absorption are presented. A combination of synchrotron self-absorption and external free-free absorption may be relevant to SN 1993J. The radii implied for the Type II supernovae SN 1979C and SN 1980K in the synchrotron self-absorption model are smaller than the radii expected for circumstellar interaction and are thus consistent with the free-free absorption mechanism.},

	Abstract = {The origin of ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) is a half-century-old enigma$^{1}$. The mystery has been deepened by an intriguing coincidence: over ten orders of magnitude in energy, the energy generation rates of UHECRs, PeV neutrinos and isotropic sub-TeV {$\gamma$}-rays are comparable, which hints at a grand unified picture$^{2}$. Here we report that powerful black hole jets in aggregates of galaxies can supply the common origin for all of these phenomena. Once accelerated by a jet, low-energy cosmic rays confined in the radio lobe are adiabatically cooled; higher-energy cosmic rays leaving the source interact with the magnetized cluster environment and produce neutrinos and {$\gamma$}-rays; the highest-energy particles escape from the host cluster and contribute to the observed cosmic rays above 100 PeV. The model is consistent with the spectrum, composition and isotropy of the observed UHECRs, and also explains the IceCube neutrinos and the non-blazar component of the Fermi {$\gamma$}-ray background, assuming a reasonable energy output from black hole jets in clusters.},

	Abstract = {The appearance of active galactic nuclei (AGN) depends so strongly on orientation that our current classification schemes are dominated by random pointing directions instead of more interesting physical properties. Light from the centers of many AGN is obscrued by optically thick circumstellar matter, particularly at optical and ultraviolet wavelengths. In radio-loud AGN, bipolar jets emanating from the nucleus emit radio through gamma-ray light that is relativistically beamed along the jet axes. Understanding the origin and magnitude of radiation anistropies in AGN allows us to unify different classes of AGN; that is, to identify each single, underlying AGN type that gives rise to different classes through different orientations. This review describes the unification of radio-loud AGN, which includes radio galaxies, quasars, and blazars. We describe the classification and general properties of AGN. We summarize the evidence for anisotropic emission caused by circumstellar obscuration and relativistic beaming. We outline the two most plausible unified schemes for radio-loud AGN, one linking the high-luminosity sources (BL Lac objects and less luminous radio galaxies). Using the formalism appropriate to samples biased by relativistic beaming, we show the population statistics for two schemes are in accordance with available data. We analyze the possible connections between low- and high-luminosity radio-loud AGN and conclude they probably are powered by similar physical processes, at least within the relativistic jet. We review potential difficulties with unification and conclude that none currently constitutes a serious problem. We discuss likely complications to unified schemes that are suggested by realistic physical considerations; these will be important to consider when more comprehensive data for larger complete samples become available. We conclude with a list of the ten questions we believe are the most pressing in this field. (SECTION: Invited Review Paper)},

	Abstract = {Empirical kappa distributions provide a straightforward replacement of the Maxwell distribution for systems out of thermal equilibrium such as space plasmas. Kappa distributions have become increasingly widespread across space physics with the number of relevant publications following, remarkably, an exponential growth rate. However, a breakthrough in the field came with the connection of kappa distributions with the framework of nonextensive statistical mechanics. This introductory paper clarifies fundamental physical concepts and provides mathematical formulations of the theory of kappa distributions, which are a consequence of the connection of kappa distributions with a solid statistical background. Among others, the paper presents the existence of a consistent definition of temperature in systems out of thermal equilibrium described by kappa distributions, the physical meaning of the kappa index, and the formulation of the kappa distribution of a Hamiltonian. In addition, the paper examines the most frequent values of kappa indices in space plasmas. Statistical analysis reveals trends between the characteristic values of density, temperature, and kappa index of space plasmas. Finally, understanding the kinetic interpretation of the temperature as the mean kinetic energy, and of the kappa index as the correlation of kinetic energies, helps to develop all the possible formulations of isotropic/anisotropic kappa distributions.},

	Abstract = {We study the implications of ultrahigh-energy cosmic-ray (UHECR) data from the Pierre Auger Observatory for potential accelerator candidates and cosmogenic neutrino fluxes for different combinations of nuclear disintegration and air-shower models. We exploit the most recent spectral and mass composition data (2017) with a new, computationally efficient simulation code, PriNCe. We extend a systematic framework, which has been previously applied in a combined fit by the Pierre Auger Collaboration, with the cosmological source evolution as an additional free parameter. In this framework, an ensemble of generalized UHECR accelerators is characterized by a universal spectral index (equal for all injection species), a maximal rigidity, and the normalizations for five nuclear element groups. We find that the 2017 data favor a small but constrained contribution of heavy elements (iron) at the source. We demonstrate that the results moderately depend on the nuclear disintegration (Puget�Stecker�Bredekamp, Peanut, or Talys) model and more strongly on the air-shower (EPOS-LHC, Sibyll 2.3, or QGSjetII-04) model. Variations of these models result in different source evolution and spectral indices, limiting the interpretation in terms of a particular class of cosmic accelerators. Better-constrained parameters include the maximal rigidity and the mass composition at the source. Hence, the cosmogenic neutrino flux can be robustly predicted. Depending on the source evolution at high redshifts, the flux is likely out of reach of future neutrino observatories in most cases, and a minimal cosmogenic neutrino flux cannot be claimed from data without assuming a cosmological distribution of the sources.},

	Abstract = {Three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of large-scale structure in the universe have shown that accretion shocks form during the gravitational collapse of one-dimensional caustics, and that clusters of galaxies formed at intersections of the caustics are surrounded by these accretion shocks. Estimated speed and curvature radius of the shocks are 1000-3000 km s$^{-1}$ and about 5 Mpc, respectively, in the {$\Omega$} = 1 cold dark matter universe. Assuming that energetic protons are accelerated by these accretion shocks via the first-order Fermi process and modeling particle transport around the shocks through Bohm diffusion, we suggest that protons can be accelerated up to the Greisen cutoff energy near 6 {\times} 10$^{19}$ eV, provided the mean magnetic field strength in the region around the shocks is at least of order 1 {$\mu$}G. We have also estimated the proton flux at Earth from the Virgo Cluster. Assuming that a few (1-10) percent of the ram pressure of the infalling matter would be transferred to the cosmic rays, the estimated flux for E {\tilde} 10$^{19}$ eV is consistent with observations, so that such clusters could be plausible sources of the ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays.},

Direct measurements of the gas velocities from the widths and shifts of X-ray emission lines were recently provided for the central region of the Perseus Cluster of galaxies by Hitomi, and upcoming high-resolution X-ray microcalorimeters onboard XRISM and Athena are expected to extend these studies to many more systems. In the mean time, several other direct and indirect methods have been proposed for estimating the velocity structure in the ICM, ranging from resonant scattering to X-ray surface brightness fluctuation analysis, the kinematic Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect, or using optical line emitting nebulae in the brightest cluster galaxies as tracers of the motions of the ambient plasma. Here, we review and compare the existing estimates of the velocities of the hot baryons, as well as the various overlapping physical processes that drive motions in the ICM, and discuss the implications of these measurements for constraining the viscosity and identifying the source of turbulence in clusters of galaxies.},

	Abstract = {Context: Thermal X-ray spectra of clusters of galaxies and other sources are commonly calculated assuming Maxwellian electron distributions. There are situations where this approximation is not valid, for instance near interfaces of hot and cold gas and near shocks.   <BR />Aims: The presence of non-thermal electrons affects the X-ray spectrum. To study the role of these electrons in clusters and other environments, an efficient algorithm is needed to calculate the X-ray spectra.   <BR />Methods: We approximate an arbitrary electron distribution by the sum of Maxwellian components. The decomposition uses either a genetic algorithm or an analytical approximation. The X-ray spectrum is then evaluated with a linear combination of those Maxwellian components. <BR />Results: Our method is fast and leads to an accurate evaluation of the spectrum. The Maxwellian components allow the use of the standard collisional rates that are available in plasma codes such as SPEX. We give an example of a spectrum for the supra-thermal electron distribution behind a shock in a cluster of galaxies. The relative intensities of the satellite lines in such a spectrum are sensitive to supra-thermal electrons. These lines can only be investigated with high spectral resolution. We show that the instruments on future missions like Astro-H and IXO will be able to demonstrate the presence or absence of these supra-thermal electrons.},

	Abstract = {Turbulence is a key ingredient for the evolution of the intracluster medium, whose properties can be predicted with high-resolution numerical simulations. We present initial results on the generation of solenoidal and compressive turbulence in the intracluster medium during the formation of a small-size cluster using highly resolved, non-radiative cosmological simulations, with a refined monitoring in time. In this first of a series of papers, we closely look at one simulated cluster whose formation was distinguished by a merger around z {\tilde} 0.3. We separate laminar gas motions, turbulence and shocks with dedicated filtering strategies and distinguish the solenoidal and compressive components of the gas flows using Hodge-Helmholtz decomposition. Solenoidal turbulence dominates the dissipation of turbulent motions ({\tilde}95 per cent) in the central cluster volume at all epochs. The dissipation via compressive modes is found to be more important ({\tilde}30 per cent of the total) only at large radii ({\ge}0.5r$_{vir}$) and close to merger events. We show that enstrophy (vorticity squared) is good proxy of solenoidal turbulence. All terms ruling the evolution of enstrophy (I.e. baroclinic, compressive, stretching and advective terms) are found to be significant, but in amounts that vary with time and location. Two important trends for the growth of enstrophy in our simulation are identified: first, enstrophy is continuously accreted into the cluster from the outside, and most of that accreted enstrophy is generated near the outer accretion shocks by baroclinic and compressive processes. Secondly, in the cluster interior vortex, stretching is dominant, although the other terms also contribute substantially.},

Under viable assumptions, this system of mutually interacting components was shown to accurately describe several observational findings related to the radio haloes in clusters of galaxies. In this paper, we add to the self-consistency of the calculations by including the generation and re-energization of secondary electrons and positrons, produced by the inelastic interactions of cosmic rays with the thermal gas in the intracluster medium. The bulk of cosmic rays are expected to be confined within the cluster volume for cosmological times, so that the rate of production of secondary electrons, as well as gamma-rays, may become correspondingly enhanced. If magnetohydrodynamic waves are present, as may be expected in the case of a recent merger event, then the reacceleration of secondary electrons and positrons can significantly affect the phenomenology of the non-thermal processes in clusters. We investigate these effects here for the first time.},

	Abstract = {The energy densities in magnetic fields and cosmic rays (CRs) in galaxies are often assumed to be in equipartition, allowing for an indirect estimate of the magnetic field strength from the observed radio synchrotron spectrum. However, both primary and secondary CRs contribute to the synchrotron spectrum, and the CR electrons also loose energy via bremsstrahlung and inverse Compton. While classical equipartition formulae avoid these intricacies, there have been recent revisions that account for the extreme conditions in starbursts. Yet, the application of the equipartition formula to starburst environments also presupposes that time-scales are long enough to reach equilibrium. Here, we test equipartition in the central molecular zones (CMZs) of nearby starburst galaxies by modelling the observed {$\gamma$}-ray spectra, which provide a direct measure of the CR energy density, and the radio spectra, which provide a probe of the magnetic field strength. We find that in starbursts, the magnetic field energy density is significantly larger than the CR energy density, demonstrating that the equipartition argument is frequently invalid for CMZs.},

	Abstract = {Observations of the FR I radio galaxy Centaurus A in radio, X-ray, and gamma-ray bands provide evidence for lepton acceleration up to several TeV and clues about hadron acceleration to tens of EeV. Synthesising the available observational constraints on the physical conditions and particle content in the jets, inner lobes and giant lobes of Centaurus A, we aim to evaluate its feasibility as an ultra-high-energy cosmic-ray source. We apply several methods of determining jet power and affirm the consistency of various power estimates of \~{}1 {\times} 10$^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Employing scaling relations based on previous results for 3C 31, we estimate particle number densities in the jets, encompassing available radio through X-ray observations. Our model is compatible with the jets ingesting \~{}3 {\times} 10$^{21}$ g s$^{-1}$ of matter via external entrainment from hot gas and \~{}7 {\times} 10$^{22}$ g s$^{-1}$ via internal entrainment from jet-contained stars. This leads to an imbalance between the internal lobe pressure available from radiating particles and magnetic field, and our derived external pressure. Based on knowledge of the external environments of other FR I sources, we estimate the thermal pressure in the giant lobes as 1.5 {\times} 10$^{-12}$ dyn cm$^{-2}$, from which we deduce a lower limit to the temperature of \~{}1.6 {\times} 10$^{8}$ K. Using dynamical and buoyancy arguments, we infer \~{}440-645 Myr and \~{}560 Myr as the sound-crossing and buoyancy ages of the giant lobes respectively, inconsistent with their spectral ages. We re-investigate the feasibility of particle acceleration via stochastic processes in the lobes, placing new constraints on the energetics and on turbulent input to the lobes.

	Abstract = {The long-held notion that the highest energy cosmic rays are of distant extragalactic origin is challenged by observations that events above ~1020 eV do not exhibit the expected high-energy cutoff from photopion production off the cosmic microwave background. We suggest that these unexpected ultra-high-energy events are due to iron nuclei accelerated from young strongly magnetized neutron stars through relativistic MHD winds. We find that neutron stars whose initial spin periods are shorter than ~10 ms and whose surface magnetic fields are in the 1012-1014 G range can accelerate iron cosmic rays to greater than ~1020 eV. These ions can pass through the remnant of the supernova explosion that produced the neutron star without suffering significant spallation reactions or energy loss. For plausible models of the Galactic magnetic field, the trajectories of the iron ions curve sufficiently to be consistent with the observed, largely isotropic arrival directions of the highest energy events.},

	Abstract = {The Auger Collaboration reports (Auger Collaboration 2007 Science�318�939, The Pierre Auger Collaboration 2008 Astropart. Phys. 29 188) that the arrival directions of ?60?EeV ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) cluster along the supergalactic plane and correlate with active galactic nuclei (AGN) within � 100?Mpc. The association of several events with the nearby radio galaxy Centaurus A supports the paradigm that UHECRs are powered by supermassive black-hole engines and accelerated to ultra-high energies in the shocks formed by variable plasma winds in the inner jets of radio galaxies. The GZK horizon length of 75?EeV UHECR protons is �100?Mpc, so that the Auger results are consistent with an assumed proton composition of the UHECRs. In this scenario, the sources of UHECRs are FR II radio galaxies and FR I galaxies like Cen A with scattered radiation fields that enhance UHECR neutral-beam production. Radio galaxies with jets pointed away from us can still be observed as UHECR sources due to deflection of UHECRs by magnetic fields in the radio lobes of these galaxies. A broadband ?1?MeV�10?EeV radiation component in the spectra of blazar AGN is formed by UHECR-induced cascade radiation in the extragalactic background light. This emission is too faint to be seen from Cen A, but could be detected from more luminous blazars.},

@article{petrosian+04,
	Abstract = {Stochastic acceleration of electrons and protons by waves propagating parallel to the large-scale magnetic fields of magnetized plasmas is studied with emphasis on the feasibility of accelerating particles from a thermal background to relativistic energies and with the aim of determining the relative acceleration of the two species in one source. In general, the stochastic acceleration by these waves results in two distinct components in the particle distributions, a quasi-thermal and a hard nonthermal, with the nonthermal one being more prominent in hotter plasmas and/or with higher level turbulence. This can explain many of the observed features of solar flares. Regarding the proton-to-electron ratio, we find that in a pure hydrogen plasma the dominance of the wave-proton interaction by the resonant Alfv�n mode reduces the acceleration rate of protons in the intermediate energy range significantly, while the electron-cyclotron and Whistler waves are very efficient in accelerating electrons from a few keV to MeV energies. The presence of such an acceleration barrier prohibits the proton acceleration under solar flare conditions. This difficulty is alleviated when we include the effects of 4He in the dispersion relation and the damping of the turbulent waves by the thermal background plasma. The additional 4He cyclotron branch of the turbulent plasma waves suppresses the proton acceleration barrier significantly, and the steep turbulence spectrum in the dissipation range makes the nonthermal component have a near power-law shape. The relative acceleration of protons and electrons is very sensitive to a plasma parameter ? = ?pe/�e, where ?pe and �e are the electron plasma frequency and gyrofrequency, respectively. Protons are preferentially accelerated in weakly magnetized plasmas (large ?). The formalism developed here is applicable to the acceleration of other ion species and to other astrophysical systems.},

	Abstract = {We derive observational consequences for the hypothesis that cosmic rays (CRs) of energy greater than 1019 eV originate in the same cosmological objects producing gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Intergalactic magnetic fields ?10-12 G are required in this model to allow CRs to be observed continuously in time by producing energy-dependent delays in the CR arrival times. This results in individual CR sources having very narrow observed spectra, since at any given time only those CRs having a fixed time delay are observed. Thus, the brightest CR sources should be different at different energies. The average number of sources contributing to the total CR flux decreases with energy much more rapidly than in a model of steady CR sources, dropping to one at Ecrit ? 2 ? 1020 eV with very weak sensitivity to the intergalactic magnetic field strength. Below Ecrit, a very large number of sources is expected, consistent with observations. Above Ecrit, a source may be observed with a flux considerably higher than the time-averaged CR flux from all sources, if a nearby GRB occurred recently. If such a source is present, its narrow spectrum may produce a �gap� in the total spectrum. These signatures should be detectable by the planned �Auger� CR experiment.},

	Abstract = {We study the sudden optical and ultraviolet (UV) brightening of 1ES 1927+654, which until now was known as a narrow-line active galactic nucleus (AGN). 1ES 1927+654 was part of the small and peculiar class of �true Type-2� AGNs that lack broad emission lines and line-of-sight obscuration. Our high-cadence spectroscopic monitoring captures the appearance of a blue, featureless continuum, followed several weeks later by the appearance of broad Balmer emission lines. This timescale is generally consistent with the expected light travel time between the central engine and the broadline emission region in (persistent) broadline AGN. Hubble Space Telescope spectroscopy reveals no evidence for broad UV emission lines (e.g., C iv ?1549, C iii] ?1909, Mg ii ?2798), probably owing to dust in the broadline emission region. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case where the lag between the change in continuum and in broadline emission of a �changing look� AGN has been temporally resolved. The nature and timescales of the photometric and spectral evolution disfavor both a change in line-of-sight obscuration and a change of the overall rate of gas inflow as driving the drastic spectral transformations seen in this AGN. Although the peak luminosity and timescales are consistent with those of tidal disruption events seen in inactive galaxies, the spectral properties are not. The X-ray emission displays a markedly different behavior, with frequent flares on timescales of hours to days, and will be presented in a companion publication.},

	Abstract = {With the successful launch of the Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Explorer, a rich trove of early X-ray afterglow data has been collected by its onboard X-Ray Telescope (XRT). Some interesting features are emerging, including a distinct rapidly decaying component preceding the conventional afterglow component in many sources, a shallow decay component before the more "normal" decay component observed in a good fraction of GRBs, and X-ray flares in nearly half of the afterglows. In this paper we systematically analyze the possible physical processes that shape the properties of the early X-ray afterglow light curves and use the data to constrain various models. We suggest that the steep decay component is consistent with the tail emission of the prompt gamma-ray bursts and/or the X-ray flares. This provides strong evidence that the prompt emission and afterglow emission are likely two distinct components, supporting the internal origin of the GRB prompt emission. The shallow decay segment observed in a group of GRBs suggests that very likely the forward shock keeps being refreshed for some time. This might be caused by either a long-lived central engine, or a wide distribution of the shell Lorentz factors, or else possibly the deceleration of a Poynting flux-dominated flow. X-ray flares suggest that the GRB central engine is very likely still active after the prompt gamma-ray emission is over, but with a reduced activity at later times. In some cases, the central engine activity even extends to days after the burst triggers. Analyses of early X-ray afterglow data reveal that GRBs are indeed highly relativistic events and that early afterglow data of many bursts, starting from the beginning of the XRT observations, are consistent with the afterglow emission from an ISM environment.},

	Abstract = {Gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows have provided important clues to the nature of these massive explosive events, providing direct information on the nearby environment and indirect information on the central engine that powers the burst. We report the discovery of two bright x-ray flares in GRB afterglows, including a giant flare comparable in total energy to the burst itself, each peaking minutes after the burst. These strong, rapid x-ray flares imply that the central engines of the bursts have long periods of activity, with strong internal shocks continuing for hundreds of seconds after the gamma-ray emission has ended.},

	Abstract = {Blazars are relativistic magnetized plasma outflows from supermassive black holes that point very close to our line of sight. Their emission is nonthermal-dominated and highly variable across the entire electromagnetic spectrum. Relativistic magnetic reconnection has been proposed as the driver of particle acceleration during blazar flares. While recent particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations have self-consistently studied the evolution of magnetic reconnection and particle acceleration therein, the resulting radiation signatures have not been systematically explored. In particular, the polarization signatures, which directly reflect the characteristic strongly dynamical evolution of magnetic field during reconnection, have not been carefully investigated. In this paper, we present a systematic study of radiation and polarization signatures arising from magnetic reconnection in blazars, based on combined PIC and polarized radiation transfer simulations with various physical parameters. We identify a harder-when-brighter trend in the spectral evolution. Moreover, higher-frequency bands (ultraviolet to X-ray) tend to flare earlier than lower-frequency bands (infrared to optical) in the synchrotron spectral component. Most importantly, polarization signatures appear more variable with higher frequencies. We find that the variation in temporal polarization depends strongly on the guide field strength. Specifically, reconnection with a significant guide field component leads to a very high polarization degree that contradicts typical blazar observations, while large polarization angle rotations are unique signatures of magnetic reconnection between nearly antiparallel magnetic field lines. These rotations are at least 90� and can extend to >180�, and they may be in either direction. These results imply that blazars that have shown large polarization angle rotations intrinsically have more nearly antiparallel magnetic field morphology.},

	Abstract = {{Particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations have shown that relativistic collisionless magnetic reconnection drives non-thermal particle acceleration (NTPA), potentially explaining high-energy (X-ray/?-ray) synchrotron and/or inverse Compton (IC) radiation observed from various astrophysical sources. The radiation back-reaction force on radiating particles has been neglected in most of these simulations, even though radiative cooling considerably alters particle dynamics in many astrophysical environments where reconnection may be important. We present a radiative PIC study examining the effects of external IC cooling on the basic dynamics, NTPA, and radiative signatures of relativistic reconnection in pair plasmas. We find that, while the reconnection rate and overall dynamics are basically unchanged, IC cooling significantly influences NTPA: the particle spectra still show a hard power law (index � ?2) as in non-radiative reconnection, but transition to a steeper power law that extends to a cooling-dependent cut-off. The steep power-law index fluctuates in time between roughly ?3 and ?5. The time-integrated photon spectra display corresponding power laws with indices �?0.5 and �?1.1, similar to those observed in hard X-ray spectra of accreting black holes.}},

	Abstract = {The IceCube Collaboration has reported neutrinos with energies between ?30 TeV and a few PeV that are significantly enhanced over the cosmic-ray induced atmospheric background. Viable high-energy neutrino sources must contain very high-energy and ultra-high-energy cosmic rays while efficiently making PeV neutrinos. Gamma-ray Bursts (GRBs) and blazars have been considered as candidate cosmic-ray accelerators. GRBs, including low-luminosity GRBs, can be efficient PeV neutrino emitters for low bulk Lorentz factor outflows, although the photopion production efficiency needs to be tuned to simultaneously explain ultra-high-energy cosmic rays. Photopion production efficiency of cosmic rays accelerated in the inner jets of flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) is ?1�10\% due to interactions with photons of the broad-line region (BLR), whereas BL Lac objects are not effective PeV neutrino sources due to the lack of external radiation fields. Photopion threshold effects with BLR photons suppress neutrino production below ?1 PeV, which implies that neutrinos from other sources would dominate over the diffuse neutrino intensity at sub-PeV energies. Reduction of the ? PeV neutrino flux can be expected when curving cosmic-ray proton distributions are employed. Considering a log-parabolic function to describe the cosmic-ray distribution, we discuss possible implications for particle acceleration in black-hole jets. Our results encourage a search for IceCube PeV neutrino events associated with ?-ray loud FSRQs using Fermi-LAT data. In our model, as found in our previous work, the neutrino flux is suppressed below 1 PeV, which can be tested with increased IceCube exposure.},

	Abstract = {{The relation between emission from the accretion disc (thermal) and the jet (non-thermal) in blazars is still a mystery as, typically, the beamed jet emission swamps the disc emission even in the ultraviolet band where disc emission peaks. In this paper we estimate the accretion disc component for 136 flat-spectrum radio quasars selected from the Deep X-ray Radio Blazar Survey. We do this by deriving the accretion disc spectrum from the mass and accretion rate on to the central black hole for each object, estimated using the emission linewidths and the power emitted from the broad-line region. We find that non-thermal emission dominates the optical/UV band of our sources. The thermal component is in fact on average ?15 per cent of the total and ? 90 per cent of the objects in the sample have a thermal component \\&lt;0.5 of the total luminosity. We then estimate the integrated disc and kinetic jet powers and find that on average the disc luminosity is ?1 to 20 times the jet power (depending on the uncertainties in the estimation of the latter quantity). A comparison with previous, independent results favours a scenario in which jet and disc powers are of the same order of magnitude. Extraction of energy from a rotating black hole via the �Blandford�Znajek� mechanism fails to explain the estimated jet power in the majority of our sources. Finally, we find that the typical masses for our sources are ?5 ? 108 M? and that, contrary to previous claims, about one quarter of our radio quasars have relatively small (\\&lt;3 ? 108 M?) black hole mass.}},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we study the photon-photon pair production optical depth for gamma rays with energies from 10 to 200 GeV emitted by powerful blazars due to the diffuse radiation field of the broad-line region (BLR). There are four key parameters in the BLR model employed to determine the ?-? attenuation optical depth of these gamma rays. They are the gamma-ray emitting radius R?, the BLR luminosity LBLR, the BLR half thickness h, and the ratio ?BLR/fcov of the Thomson optical depth to the covering factor of BLR. For FSRQs, on average, it is impossible for gamma rays with energies from 10 to 200 GeV to escape from the diffuse radiation field of the BLR. If GLAST could detect these gamma rays for most of FSRQs, the gamma-ray emitting region is likely to be outside the cavity formed by the BLR. Otherwise, the emitting region is likely to be inside the BLR cavity. As examples, we estimate the photon-photon absorption optical depth of gamma rays with energies from 10 to 200 GeV for two powerful blazars, HFSRQ PKS 0405-123 and FSRQ 3C 279. Comparing our results with GLAST observations in the future could test whether the model employed and the relevant assumptions in this paper are reliable and reasonable, and then limit constraints on the position of the gamma-ray emitting region relative to the BLR and the properties of the BLR.},

	Abstract = {The chemical composition of the ultra-high-energy (UHE) cosmic rays serves as an important clue to their origin. Recent measurements of the elongation rates by the Pierre Auger Observatory hint at the possible presence of heavy or intermediate-mass nuclei in the UHE cosmic rays. Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and hypernovae have been suggested as possible sources of the UHE cosmic rays. Here we derive constraints on the physical conditions under which UHE heavy nuclei, if they are accelerated in these sources, can survive in their intense photon fields. We find that in the GRB external shock and hypernova scenarios, UHE nuclei can easily survive photodisintegration. In the GRB internal shock scenario, UHE nuclei can also survive, provided the dissipation radius and/or the bulk Lorentz factor of the relativistic outflow are relatively large, or if the low-energy self-absorption break in the photon spectrum of the prompt emission occurs above several keV. In internal shocks and in the other scenarios, intermediate-mass UHE nuclei have a higher probability of survival against photodisintegration than UHE heavy nuclei such as Fe.},

	abstract = {Galactic cosmic rays (CRs) are accelerated at the forward shocks of supernova remnants (SNRs) via diffusive shock acceleration (DSA), an efficient acceleration mechanism that predicts power-law energy distributions of CRs. However, observations of nonthermal SNR emission imply CR energy distributions that are generally steeper than E −2, the standard DSA prediction. Recent results from kinetic hybrid simulations suggest that such steep spectra may arise from the drift of magnetic structures with respect to the thermal plasma downstream of the shock. Using a semi-analytic model of nonlinear DSA, we investigate the implications that these results have on the phenomenology of a wide range of SNRs. By accounting for the motion of magnetic structures in the downstream, we produce CR energy distributions that are substantially steeper than E −2 and consistent with observations. Our formalism reproduces both modestly steep spectra of Galactic SNRs (∝E −2.2) and the very steep spectra of young radio supernovae (∝E −3).}

	Abstract = {Galactic winds are observed in many spiral galaxies with sizes from         dwarfs up to the Milky Way, and they sometimes carry a mass in         excess of that of newly formed stars by up to a factor of 10.         Multiple driving processes of such winds have been proposed,         including thermal pressure due to supernova heating, ultraviolet         radiation pressure on dust grains or cosmic ray (CR) pressure.         We here study wind formation due to CR physics using a numerical         model that accounts for CR acceleration by supernovae, CR         thermalization by Coulomb and hadronic interactions, and         advective CR transport. In addition, we introduce a novel         implementation of CR streaming relative to the rest frame of the         gas. Streaming CRs excite Alfv{\'e}n waves on which they         scatter, thereby limiting the CRs' effective bulk velocity. We         find that CR streaming drives powerful and sustained winds in         galaxies with virial masses ?. In dwarf galaxies (?) the winds         reach a mass loading factor of {\ensuremath{\sim}}5, expel         {\ensuremath{\sim}}60 per cent of the initial baryonic mass         contained inside the halo's virial radius and suppress the star         formation rate by a factor of {\ensuremath{\sim}}5. In dwarfs,         the winds are spherically symmetric while in larger galaxies the         outflows transition to biconical morphologies that are aligned         with the disc's angular momentum axis. We show that damping of         Alfv{\'e}n waves excited by streaming CRs provides a means of         heating the outflows to temperatures that scale with the square         of the escape speed, ?. In larger haloes (?), CR streaming is         able to drive fountain flows that excite turbulence, providing         another means of heating the halo gas. For halo masses ?, we         predict an observable level of H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} and X-ray         emission from the heated halo gas. We conclude that CR-driven         winds should be crucial in suppressing and regulating the first         epoch of galaxy formation, expelling a large fraction of         baryons, and - by extension - aid in shaping the faint end of         the galaxy luminosity function. They should then also be         responsible for much of the metal enrichment of the         intergalactic medium.},

	Abstract = {We present results from high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations of         isolated Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC)- and Milky-Way-sized         galaxies that include a model for feedback from galactic cosmic         rays (CRs). We find that CRs are naturally able to drive winds         with mass loading factors of up to         \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde10 in dwarf systems. The scaling         of the mass loading factor with circular velocity between the         two simulated systems is consistent with eta         propto v\_circ\^\{1-2\} required to reproduce the         faint end of the galaxy luminosity function. In addition,         simulations with CR feedback reproduce both the normalization         and the slope of the observed trend of wind velocity with galaxy         circular velocity. We find that winds in simulations with CR         feedback exhibit qualitatively different properties compared to         supernova-driven winds, where most of acceleration happens         violently in situ near star forming sites. The CR-driven winds         are accelerated gently by the large-scale pressure gradient         established by CRs diffusing from the star-forming galaxy disk         out into the halo. The CR-driven winds also exhibit much cooler         temperatures and, in the SMC-sized system, warm (T         \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde {}10$^{4}$ K) gas dominates the         outflow. The prevalence of warm gas in such outflows may provide         a clue as to the origin of ubiquitous warm gas in the gaseous         halos of galaxies detected via absorption lines in quasar         spectra.},

	Abstract = {Relativistic magnetized jets from active galaxies are among the most         powerful cosmic accelerators, but their particle acceleration         mechanisms remain a mystery. We present a new acceleration         mechanism associated with the development of the helical kink         instability in relativistic jets, which leads to the efficient         conversion of the jet's magnetic energy into nonthermal         particles. Large-scale three-dimensional ab initio simulations         reveal that the formation of highly tangled magnetic fields and         a large-scale inductive electric field throughout the kink-         unstable region promotes rapid energization of the particles.         The energy distribution of the accelerated particles develops a         well-defined power-law tail extending to the radiation-reaction         limited energy in the case of leptons, and to the confinement         energy of the jet in the case of ions. When applied to the         conditions of well-studied bright knots in jets from active         galaxies, this mechanism can account for the spectrum of         synchrotron and inverse Compton radiating particles, and offers         a viable means of accelerating ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays to 1         {}0$^{20}$ eV .},

PIC         applications have grown extensively, with large computing powers         available on supercomputers such as Pleiades and Blue Waters in         the US. For astrophysical plasma research, PIC methods have been         utilized for several topics, such as reconnection, pulsar         dynamics, non-relativistic shocks, relativistic shocks, and         relativistic jets. PIC simulations of relativistic jets have         been reviewed with emphasis placed on the physics involved in         the simulations. This review summarizes PIC simulations,         starting with the Weibel instability in slab models of jets, and         then focuses on global jet evolution in helical magnetic field         geometry. In particular, we address kinetic Kelvin-Helmholtz         instabilities and mushroom instabilities.},

	Abstract = {In the study of relativistic jets one of the key open questions is their         interaction with the environment. Here we study the initial         evolution of both electron-proton (\{e\}$^{\{--}$\}-\{p\}$^{+}$)         and electron-positron (e$^{{\ensuremath{\pm}}}$) relativistic         jets, focusing on their lateral interaction with ambient plasma.         We follow the evolution of toroidal magnetic fields generated by         both the kinetic Kelvin-Helmholtz and Mushroom instabilities.         For an \{e\}$^{\{--}$\}-\{p\}$^{+}$ jet, the induced magnetic         field collimates the jet and electrons are perpendicularly         accelerated. As the instabilities saturate and subsequently         weaken, the magnetic polarity switches from clockwise to         counterclockwise in the middle of the jet. For an         e$^{{\ensuremath{\pm}}}$ jet, we find strong mixing of electrons         and positrons with the ambient plasma, resulting in the creation         of a bow shock. The merging of current filaments generates         density inhomogeneities that initiate a forward shock. Strong         jet-ambient plasma mixing prevents a full development of the jet         (on the scale studied), revealing evidence for both jet         collimation and particle acceleration in the forming bow shock.         Differences in the magnetic field structure generated by         \{e\}$^{\{--}$\}-\{p\}$^{+}$ and e$^{{\ensuremath{\pm}}}$ jets         may contribute to the polarization properties of the observed         emission in AGN jets and gamma-ray bursts.},

	Abstract = {Particle energization in shear flows is invoked to explain nonthermal         emission from the boundaries of relativistic astrophysical jets.         Yet the physics of particle injection, i.e., the mechanism that         allows thermal particles to participate in shear-driven         acceleration, remains unknown. With particle-in-cell         simulations, we study the development of Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH)         instabilities seeded by the velocity shear between a         relativistic magnetically dominated electron-positron jet and a         weakly magnetized electron-ion ambient plasma.

The code provides a multiphysics, multialgorithm modular environment particularly oriented toward the treatment of astrophysical flows in presence of discontinuities. Different hydrodynamic modules and algorithms may be independently selected to properly describe Newtonian, relativistic, MHD, or relativistic MHD fluids. The modular structure exploits a general framework for integrating a system of conservation laws, built on modern Godunov-type shock-capturing schemes. Although a plethora of numerical methods has been successfully developed over the past two decades, the vast majority shares a common discretization recipe, involving three general steps: a piecewise polynomial reconstruction followed by the solution of Riemann problems at zone interfaces and a final evolution stage. We have checked and validated the code against several benchmarks available in literature. Test problems in 1, 2, and 3 dimensions are discussed.}

	journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
	abstract = {In the past few years wide-field optical and UV transient surveys and X-ray telescopes have allowed us to identify a few dozen candidate tidal disruption events (TDEs). While in theory the physical processes in TDEs are ubiquitous, a few distinct classes of TDEs have been observed. Some TDEs radiate mainly in NUV/optical, while others produce prominent X-rays. Moreover, relativistic jets have been observed in only a handful of TDEs. This diversity might be related to the details of the super-Eddington accretion and emission physics relevant to TDE disks. In this Letter, we utilize novel three-dimensional general relativistic radiation magnetohydrodynamics simulations to study the super-Eddington compact disk phase expected in TDEs. Consistent with previous studies, geometrically thick disks, wide-angle optically thick fast outflows, and relativistic jets are produced. The outflow density and velocity depend sensitively on the inclination angle, and hence so does the reprocessing of emission produced from the inner disk. We then use Monte Carlo radiative transfer to calculate the reprocessed spectra and find that that the observed ratio of optical to X-ray fluxes increases with increasing inclination angle. This naturally leads to a unified model for different classes of TDEs in which the spectral properties of the TDE depend mainly on the viewing angle of the observer with respect to the orientation of the disk.}

  abstract      = {The cluster 1RXS J0603.3+4214 is a merging galaxy cluster that hosts         three radio relics and a giant radio halo. The northern relic,         the Toothbrush, is 1.9 Mpc long and has an unusual linear         morphology. According to simple diffusive shock acceleration         theory, its radio spectral index indicates a Mach number of         3.3-4.6. Here, we present results from a deep XMM-Newton         observation of the cluster. We observe two distinct cluster         cores that have survived the merger. The presence of three         shocks at or near the locations of the radio relics is confirmed         by density and temperature discontinuities. However, the         observation poses several puzzles that challenge our         understanding of radio relics: (i) at the Toothbrush, the shock         Mach number is not larger than 2, in apparent conflict with the         shock strength predicted from the radio spectrum; (ii) at the         Toothbrush, the shock front is, in part, spatially offset from         the radio emission; (iii) at the eastern relic, we detect a         temperature jump corresponding to a Mach number of approximately         2.5, but there is no associated surface brightness         discontinuity. We discuss possible explanations for these         findings.},

    abstract = "{Astrophysical jets reveal strong signs of radial structure. They suggest that the inner region of the jet, the jet spine, consists of a low-density, fast-moving gas, while the outer region of the jet consists of a more dense and slower moving gas, called the jet sheath. Moreover, if jets carry angular momentum, the resultant centrifugal forces lead to a radial stratification. Current observations are not able to fully resolve the radial structure, so little is known about its actual profile. We present three active galactic nuclei jet models in 2.5D of which two have been given a radial structure. The first model is a homogeneous jet, the only model that does not carry angular momentum; the second model is a spine–sheath jet with an isothermal equation of state; and the third jet model is a (piecewise) isochoric spine–sheath jet, with constant but different densities for jet spine and jet sheath. In this paper, we look at the effects of radial stratification on jet integrity, mixing between the different jet components and global morphology of the jet-head and surrounding cocoon. We consider steady jets that have been active for 23 Myr. All jets have developed the same number of strong internal shocks along their jet axis at the final time of simulation. These shocks arise when vortices are being shed by the jet-head. We find that all three jets maintain their stability all the way up to the jet-head. The isothermal jet maintains part of its structural integrity at the jet-head where the distinction between jet spine and jet sheath material can still be made. In this case, mixing between jet spine and jet sheath within the jet is fairly inefficient. The isochoric jet, on the other hand, loses its structural jet integrity fairly quickly after the jet is injected. At its jet-head, little structure is maintained and the central part of the jet predominantly consists of jet sheath material. In this case, jet spine and jet sheath material mix efficiently within the jet. We find that the propagation speed for all three models is less than expected from simple theoretical predictions. We propose this is due to an enlarged cross-section of the jet which impacts with the ambient medium. We show that in these models, the effective surface area is 16 times as large in the case of the homogeneous jet, 30 times as large in the case of the isochoric jet and can be up to 40 times as large in the case of the isothermal jet.}",

	journal = {ApJ},
	abstract = {Centaurus A (Cen A) is the nearest active radio galaxy, which has kiloparsec-scale jets and giant lobes detected by various instruments in radio and X-ray frequency ranges. The Fermi-Large Area Telescope and High Energy Stereoscopic System (HESS) confirmed that Cen A is a very high-energy (VHE; >0.1 TeV) γ-ray emitter with a known spectral softening in the energy range from a few GeV to TeV. In this work, we consider a synchrotron self-Compton model in the nucleus for the broadband spectrum below the break energy and an external Compton model in kiloparsec-scale jets for the γ-ray excess. Our results show that the observed γ-ray excess can be suitably described by the inverse Compton scattering of the starlight photons in the kiloparsec-scale jets, which is consistent with the recent tentative report by HESS on the spatial extension of the TeV emission along the jets. Considering the spectral fitting results, the excess can only be seen in Cen A, which is probably due to two factors: (1) the host galaxy is approximately 50 times more luminous than other typical radio galaxies and (2) the core γ-ray spectrum quickly decays above a few MeV due to the low maximum electron Lorentz factor of γc = 2.8 × 103 resulting from the large magnetic field of 3.8 G in the core. By the comparison with other γ-ray detected radio galaxies, we found that the magnetic field strength of relativistic jets scales with the distance from the central black holes d with B(d) ∝ d−0.88 ± 0.14.}

We set complementary constraints by using the 2MASS Redshift Survey (2MRS) catalogue, which maps the matter distribution of the local Universe. Assuming that the distribution of the neutrino sources follows that of matter, we look for correlations between ``warm'' spots on the IceCube skymap and the 2MRS matter distribution. Through Monte Carlo simulations of the expected number of neutrino multiplets and careful modelling of the detector performance (including that of IceCube-Gen2), we demonstrate that sources with local density exceeding 10−6 Mpc−3 and neutrino luminosity Lν ≲ 1042 erg s−1 (1041 erg s−1) will be efficiently revealed by our method using IceCube (IceCube-Gen2). At low luminosities such as will be probed by IceCube-Gen2, the sensitivity of this analysis is superior to requiring statistically significant direct observation of a point source.}

abstract = {Weakly interacting neutrinos are ideal astronomical messengers because they travel through space without deflection by magnetic fields and, essentially, without absorption. Their weak interaction also makes them notoriously difficult to detect, with observation of high-energy neutrinos from distant sources requiring kilometer-scale detectors. The IceCube project transformed a cubic kilometer of natural Antarctic ice at the geographic South Pole into a Cherenkov detector. It discovered a flux of cosmic neutrinos in the energy range from 10 TeV to 10 PeV, predominantly extragalactic in origin. Their corresponding energy density is close to that of high-energy photons detected by gamma-ray satellites and ultra-high-energy cosmic rays observed with large surface detectors. Neutrinos are therefore ubiquitous in the nonthermal universe, suggesting a more significant role of protons (nuclei) relative to electrons than previously anticipated. Thus, anticipating an essential role for multimessenger astronomy, IceCube is planning significant upgrades of the present instrument as well as a next-generation detector. Similar detectors are under construction in the Mediterranean Sea and Lake Baikal.}

This group catalog is based on the first near-IR all-sky flux-limited survey that is complete to |b| = 5°. We explore the dependence of the clustering on the length and velocity scales involved. The paper describes a group catalog, complete to a limiting redshift of 104 km s-1, created by maximizing the number of groups containing three or more members. A second catalog is also presented, created by requiring a minimum density contrast of δρ/ρ ≥ 80 to identify groups. We identify known nearby clusters in the catalogs and contrast the groups identified in the two catalogs. We examine and compare the properties of the determined groups and verify that the results are consistent with the UZC-SSRS2 and northern CfA redshift survey group catalogs. The all-sky nature of the catalog will allow the development of a flow-field model based on the density field inferred from the estimated cluster masses.}

From these samples, we first examine the correlation between the luminosities at 5 GHz, L5 GHz, and at 0.1–10 GeV, Lγ, of gamma-ray-loud radio galaxies. We find that the correlation is significant with Lγ∝L1.165 GHz based on a partial correlation analysis. Using this correlation and the radio luminosity function (RLF) of radio galaxies, we explore the contribution of gamma-ray-loud radio galaxies to the unresolved extragalactic gamma-ray background (EGRB). The gamma-ray luminosity function is obtained by normalizing the RLF to reproduce the source-count distribution of the Fermi gamma-ray-loud radio galaxies. We find that gamma-ray-loud radio galaxies can explain ∼25% of the unresolved Fermi EGRB flux above 100 MeV and will also make a significant contribution to the EGRB in the 1–30 MeV energy band. Since blazars explain 22% of the EGRB above 100 MeV, radio-loud active galactic nucleus populations explain ∼47% of the unresolved EGRB. We further make an interpretation on the origin of the EGRB. The observed EGRB spectrum at 0.2–100 GeV does not show an absorption signature by the extragalactic background light. Thus, the dominant population of the origin of EGRB at very high energy (>30 GeV) might be either nearby gamma-ray-emitting sources or sources with very hard gamma-ray spectra.}

We perform a fit of the UHECR spectrum and composition measured by the Pierre Auger Observatory for four source emissivity scenarios: power-law redshift dependence with one free parameter, active galactic nuclei, gamma-ray bursts, and star formation history. We show that negative source emissivity evolution is favoured if we treat the source evolution as a free parameter. In all cases, the best fit is obtained for relatively hard spectral indices and low maximal rigidities, for compositions at injection dominated by intermediate nuclei (nitrogen and silicon groups). In light of these results, we calculate the associated fluxes of neutrinos and photons. Finally, we discuss the prospects for the future generation of high-energy neutrino and gamma-ray observatories to constrain the sources of UHECRs.}

The proton dip model describes their spectral shape in the energy range above 109 GeV by pair production and photohadronic interactions with the cosmic microwave background. The photohadronic interactions also produce cosmogenic neutrinos peaking around 109 GeV. We test whether this model is still viable in light of recent UHECR spectrum measurements from the Telescope Array experiment and upper limits on the cosmogenic neutrino flux from IceCube. While two-parameter fits have been already presented, we perform a full scan of the three main physical model parameters: source redshift evolution, injected proton maximal energy, and spectral index. We find qualitatively different conclusions compared to earlier two-parameter fits in the literature: a mild preference for a maximal energy cutoff at the sources instead of the Greisen–Zatsepin–Kuzmin cutoff, hard injection spectra, and strong source evolution. The predicted cosmogenic neutrino flux exceeds the IceCube limit for any parameter combination. As a result, the proton dip model is challenged at more than 95% C.L. This is strong evidence against this model independent of mass composition measurements.}

Therefore, we calculated the flux of high-energy cosmogenic neutrinos arriving at the Earth on the basis of elaborate 4D simulations that take into account three spatial degrees of freedom and the cosmological time-evolution of the universe. Our predictions for this neutrino flux are consistent with the recent upper limits obtained from large-scale cosmic-ray experiments. We also show that the extragalactic magnetic field has a strong influence on the neutrino flux. The results of this work are important for the design of future neutrino observatories, since they allow to assess the detector volume and observation time that are necessary to detect high-energy cosmogenic neutrinos in the near future. An observation of such neutrinos would push multimessenger astronomy to hitherto unachieved energy scales.}",

	abstract = {A flux of extra-terrestrial neutrinos at energies ≫1015 eV has the potential to serve as a cosmological probe of the high-energy universe as well as tests of fundamental particle interactions. Cosmogenic neutrinos, produced from the interactions of ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) with cosmic photon backgrounds, have been regarded as a guaranteed flux. However, the expected neutrino flux depends on the composition of UHECRs at the highest energies; heavier nuclei result in lower neutrino fluxes compared to lighter nuclei and protons. The objective of this study is to estimate the range of cosmogenic neutrino spectra consistent with recent cosmic-ray spectral and compositional data using a fully inferential Bayesian approach. The study assumes a range of source distributions consistent with astrophysical sources, the flux and composition of cosmic rays, and detector systematic uncertainties. The technique applied to this study is the use of an affine-invariant Markov Chain Monte Carlo, which is an effective Bayesian inference tool for characterizing multi-dimensional parameter spaces and their correlations.}

abstract = {We report on studies of the viability and sensitivity of the Askaryan Radio Array (ARA), a new initiative to develop a Teraton-scale ultra-high energy neutrino detector in deep, radio-transparent ice near Amundsen-Scott station at the South Pole. An initial prototype ARA detector system was installed in January 2011, and has been operating continuously since then. We describe measurements of the background radio noise levels, the radio clarity of the ice, and the estimated sensitivity of the planned ARA array given these results, based on the first five months of operation. Anthropogenic radio interference in the vicinity of the South Pole currently leads to a few-percent loss of data, but no overall effect on the background noise levels, which are dominated by the thermal noise floor of the cold polar ice, and galactic noise at lower frequencies. We have also successfully detected signals originating from a 2.5km deep impulse generator at a distance of over 3 km from our prototype detector, confirming prior estimates of kilometer-scale attenuation lengths for cold polar ice. These are also the first such measurements for propagation over such large slant distances in ice. Based on these data, ARA-37, the ∼200km2 array now in its initial construction phase, will achieve the highest sensitivity of any planned or existing neutrino detector in the 1016–1019eV energy range.}

The most neutrino-like background stems from the radio emission of air showers. This article reports on dedicated efforts of simulating and detecting the signals of cosmic rays. A description of the fully radio self-triggered data-set, the properties of the detected air shower signals in the frequency range of 100–500 MHz and the consequences for neutrino detection are given. 38 air shower signals are identified by their distinct waveform characteristics, are in good agreement with simulations and their signals provide evidence that neutrino-induced radio signals will be distinguishable with high efficiency in ARIANNA. The cosmic ray flux at a mean energy of 6.5−1.0+1.2×1017 eV is measured to be 1.1−0.7+1.0×10−16 eV−1 km−2 sr−1 yr−1 and one five-fold coincident event is used to illustrate the capabilities of the ARIANNA detector to reconstruct arrival direction and energy of air showers.}

	abstract = {Neutrinos interact only very weakly with matter, but giant detectors have succeeded in detecting small numbers of astrophysical neutrinos. Aside from a diffuse background, only two individual sources have been identified: the Sun and a nearby supernova in 1987. A multiteam collaboration detected a high-energy neutrino event whose arrival direction was consistent with a known blazar{\textemdash}a type of quasar with a relativistic jet oriented directly along our line of sight. The blazar, TXS 0506+056, was found to be undergoing a gamma-ray flare, prompting an extensive multiwavelength campaign. Motivated by this discovery, the IceCube collaboration examined lower-energy neutrinos detected over the previous several years, finding an excess emission at the location of the blazar. Thus, blazars are a source of astrophysical neutrinos.Science, this issue p. 147, p. eaat1378A high-energy neutrino event detected by IceCube on 22 September 2017 was coincident in direction and time with a gamma-ray flare from the blazar TXS 0506+056. Prompted by this association, we investigated 9.5 years of IceCube neutrino observations to search for excess emission at the position of the blazar. We found an excess of high-energy neutrino events, with respect to atmospheric backgrounds, at that position between September 2014 and March 2015. Allowing for time-variable flux, this constitutes 3.5σ evidence for neutrino emission from the direction of TXS 0506+056, independent of and prior to the 2017 flaring episode. This suggests that blazars are identifiable sources of the high-energy astrophysical neutrino flux.},

	abstract = {In the espresso scenario, ultra-high-energy (UHE) cosmic rays (CRs) are produced via a one-shot reacceleration of galactic-like CRs in the relativistic jets of active galactic nuclei, independently of the scattering rate dictated by magnetic fluctuations. In Mbarek & Caprioli (2019) we traced test-particle CRs in high-resolution magnetohyrodynamic (MHD) jet simulations and found that the associated spectral slope, chemical composition, and anisotropy are consistent with UHECR phenomenology. In this work, we extend such an analysis by including subgrid pitch-angle scattering to model small-scale magnetic turbulence that cannot be resolved by MHD simulations. We find that a large scattering rate unlocks stochastic acceleration and fosters the energization of lower-energy CRs, which eventually leads to harder UHECR spectra. Yet, the particles that achieve the highest energies (up to the Hillas limit) are invariably produced by espresso acceleration and their spectrum is independent of the assumed subgrid scattering rate.}

The linear and quasi‐linear stages of the instability are found to be in good agreement with known results for the resonant mode propagating parallel to the beam along the magnetic field and with theory developed in this paper for the nonresonant mode, which propagates antiparallel to the beam direction. The quasi‐linear stage, which produces large amplitude δB ∼ B, sinusoidal transverse waves and “intermediate” ion distributions, is terminated by a nonlinear phase in which strongly nonlinear, compressive waves and “diffuse” ion distributions are produced. Additional processes by which the diffuse ions are accelerated to observed high energies are not addressed. The results are discussed in terms of the ion distributions and hydromagnetic waves observed in the foreshock of the earth's bow shock and of interplanetary shocks.}

Soc. 353 550) has reanalysed the problem of wave excitation by cosmic rays propagating in the pre-cursor region of a supernova remnant shock front. He pointed out a strong, non-resonant, current-driven instability that had been overlooked in the kinetic treatments by Achterberg (1983 Astron. Astrophys. 119 274) and McKenzie and Völk (1982 Astron. Astrophys. 116 191), and suggested that it is responsible for substantial amplification of the ambient magnetic field. Magnetic field amplification is also an important issue in the problem of the formation and structure of relativistic shock fronts, particularly in relation to models of gamma-ray bursts. We have therefore generalized the linear analysis to apply to this case, assuming a relativistic background plasma and a monoenergetic, unidirectional incoming proton beam. We find essentially the same non-resonant instability observed by Bell and show that also, under GRB conditions, it grows much faster than the resonant waves. We quantify the extent to which thermal effects in the background plasma limit the maximum growth rate.}"

We find that, under typical SNR conditions, either the resonant instability or the Weibel instability is the most unstable. This mechanism may amplify the magnetic field to more than 100 μG and changes the shock structure.

    abstract = "{The nature of the intense X-ray emission from powerful extragalactic jets at large (\\&gt;1 kpc) scale is still debated. The scenario that invokes the inverse Compton scattering of the cosmic microwave background by electrons is challenged by the lack of gamma-ray emission in the GeV band. An alternative assumes synchrotron emission by a distinct population of ultra-high energy electrons. Here, we present a concrete attempt to apply this scenario, exploring the specific model in which the ultra-high energy electrons are accelerated in a shear layer surrounding the jet. We limit the study to non-relativistic flows and particle acceleration is treated by a Fokker–Planck equation. The observed relation between low energy (radio, optical) and X-ray emission prompts us to assume that the required population of pre-accelerated particles is provided by a shock responsible for the acceleration of the electrons emitting at low frequencies. We apply the model to the emission of the principal knots of the jets of PKS 0637–752 and PKS 1136–135, two of the best-studied objects. For the set of fiducial parameters adopted, the condition that the jet power does not exceeds a limiting value of 1048 erg s−1 constrains the magnetic field above \\$10\\, \\mu\\$G and indicates moderate beaming (δ ≃ 2) for PKS 0637–752. For both sources, the requirement that acceleration of the electrons proceeds faster than radiative cooling can be met if the magnetic turbulence in the shear layer follows a Kolmogorov spectrum, I(k) ∝ k−q with q = 5/3, but cannot satisfied in the Bohm-like case (q = 1).}",

abstract = {Fanaroff-Riley (FR) 0 radio galaxies compose a new class of radio galaxies, which are usually weaker but much more numerous than the well-established class of FR 1 and FR 2 galaxies. The latter classes have been proposed as sources of the ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) with energies reaching up to ∼1020 eV. Based on this conjecture, the possibility of UHECR acceleration and survival in an FR 0 source environment is examined in this work. In doing so, an average spectral energy distribution (SED) based on data from the FR 0 catalog (FR0CAT) is compiled. The resulting photon fields are used as targets for UHECRs, which suffer from electromagnetic pair production, photo-disintegration, photo-meson production losses, and synchrotron radiation. Multiple mechanisms are discussed to assess the UHECR acceleration probability, including Fermi-I order and gradual shear accelerations, and particle escape from the source region. This work shows that in a hybrid scenario, combining Fermi and shear accelerations, FR 0 galaxies can contribute to the observed UHECR flux, as long as Γj≳1.6, where shear acceleration starts to dominate over escape. Even in less optimistic scenarios, FR 0s can be expected to contribute to the cosmic-ray flux between the knee and the ankle. Our results are relatively robust with respect to the realized magnetic turbulence model and the speed of the accelerating shocks.}

	journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
	abstract = {The origin of the extended X-ray emission in the large-scale jets of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) poses challenges to conventional models of acceleration and emission. Although electron synchrotron radiation is considered the most feasible radiation mechanism, the formation of the continuous large-scale X-ray structure remains an open issue. As astrophysical jets are expected to exhibit some turbulence and shearing motion, we here investigate the potential of shearing flows to facilitate an extended acceleration of particles and evaluate its impact on the resultant particle distribution. Our treatment incorporates systematic shear and stochastic second-order Fermi effects. We show that for typical parameters applicable to large-scale AGN jets, stochastic second-order Fermi acceleration, which always accompanies shear particle acceleration, can play an important role in facilitating the whole process of particle energization. We study the time-dependent evolution of the resultant particle distribution in the presence of second-order Fermi acceleration, shear acceleration, and synchrotron losses using a simple Fokker–Planck approach and provide illustrations for the possible emergence of a complex (multicomponent) particle energy distribution with different spectral branches. We present examples for typical parameters applicable to large-scale AGN jets, indicating the relevance of the underlying processes for understanding the extended X-ray emission and the origin of ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays.}

    abstract = "{We present the results of Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) observations regarding the properties of FR0 radio galaxies, the compact radio sources associated with early-type galaxies that represent the bulk of the local radio-loud population of active galactic nuclei. We obtained A-array observations at 1.5, 4.5 and 7.5 GHz for 18 FR0s from the FR0CAT sample: these are sources at \\$z\\$ \\&lt; 0.05, which are unresolved in the FIRST images and spectroscopically classified as low-excitation galaxies (LEGs). Although we reach an angular resolution of ∼0.3 arcsec, the majority of the 18 FR0s are still unresolved. Only four objects show extended emission. Six have steep radio spectra, 11 have flat cores, while one shows an inverted spectrum. We find that (i) the ratio between the core and total emission in FR0s is ∼30 times higher than that in FRIs, and (ii) FR0s have the same properties as FRIs from the nuclear and host points of view. FR0s differ from FRIs only in the paucity of extended radio emission. Various evolutionary scenarios were investigated: (i) the possibility that all FR0s are young sources eventually evolving into extended sources was ruled out by the distribution of radio sizes; (ii) similarly, a time-dependent scenario, in which a variation of accretion or jet launching prevents the formation of large-scale radio structures, appears to be implausible owing to the large abundance of subkiloparsec objects; (iii) a scenario in which FR0s are produced by mildly relativistic jets is consistent with the data but requires observations of a larger sample if it is to be properly tested.}",

    abstract = "{Fanaroff–Riley type 0 radio galaxies (FR0s) are compact radio sources that represent the bulk of the radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGN) population, but they are still poorly understood. Pilot studies on these sources have been already performed at radio and optical wavelengths: here we present the first X-ray study of a sample of 19 FR0 radio galaxies selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey/NRAO VLA Sky Survey/Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-cm sample of Best \\&amp; Heckman, with redshift ≤0.15, radio size ≤10 kpc, and optically classified as low-excitation galaxies. The X-ray spectra are modelled with a power-law component absorbed by Galactic
column density with, in some cases, a contribution from thermal extended gas. The X-ray photons are likely produced by the jet as attested by the observed correlation between X-ray (2–10 keV) and radio (5 GHz) luminosities, similar to Fanaroff–Riley type I radio galaxies (FRIs). The estimated Eddington-scaled luminosities indicate a low accretion rate. Overall, we find that the X-ray properties of FR0s are indistinguishable from those of FRIs, thus adding another similarity between AGN associated with compact and extended radio sources. A comparison between FR0s and low-luminosity BL Lacs rules out important beaming effects in the X-ray emission of the compact radio galaxies. FR0s have different X-ray properties with respect to young radio sources (e.g. gigahertz-peaked spectrum/compact steep spectrum sources), generally characterized by higher X-ray luminosities and more complex spectra. In conclusion, the paucity of extended radio emission in FR0s is probably related to the intrinsic properties of their jets that prevent the formation of extended structures, and/or to intermittent activity of their engines.}",

	abstract = {So-called FR0 radio galaxies have recently emerged as a family of active galaxies with all the same properties as FRI radio galaxies except for their ratio of core to total emission, which is about 30 times higher than that of FRI sources. We show how their properties fit within the gap paradigm as low, prograde, spinning black holes whose progenitors are powerful FRII quasars that transitioned rapidly from the cold mode into advection-dominated accretion over a few million years. The prediction is that if sufficient fuel exists, FR0 radio galaxies will evolve into full-fledged FRI radio galaxies and the observational dearth of FRI radio galaxies compared to FR0s at low redshift tells us about the supply of gas in the low-redshift FR0s. Given the model prescription, this 5–1 FR0 to FRI ratio implies that at low redshift, the FRII quasar class of active galaxies struggles to fuel its black hole beyond 1.3 times its original mass. In addition to this, we illustrate model prescriptions for the black hole mass, black hole spin, redshift, and environment distribution for FR0 radio galaxies by fitting them within a paradigm that views them as a continuous class of active galaxies that are sandwiched between FRII quasars and FRI radio galaxies.}

	abstract = {Neutrinos interact only very weakly with matter, but giant detectors have succeeded in detecting small numbers of astrophysical neutrinos. Aside from a diffuse background, only two individual sources have been identified: the Sun and a nearby supernova in 1987. A multiteam collaboration detected a high-energy neutrino event whose arrival direction was consistent with a known blazar{\textemdash}a type of quasar with a relativistic jet oriented directly along our line of sight. The blazar, TXS 0506+056, was found to be undergoing a gamma-ray flare, prompting an extensive multiwavelength campaign. Motivated by this discovery, the IceCube collaboration examined lower-energy neutrinos detected over the previous several years, finding an excess emission at the location of the blazar. Thus, blazars are a source of astrophysical neutrinos.Science, this issue p. 147, p. eaat1378INTRODUCTIONNeutrinos are tracers of cosmic-ray acceleration: electrically neutral and traveling at nearly the speed of light, they can escape the densest environments and may be traced back to their source of origin. High-energy neutrinos are expected to be produced in blazars: intense extragalactic radio, optical, x-ray, and, in some cases, γ-ray sources characterized by relativistic jets of plasma pointing close to our line of sight. Blazars are among the most powerful objects in the Universe and are widely speculated to be sources of high-energy cosmic rays. These cosmic rays generate high-energy neutrinos and γ-rays, which are produced when the cosmic rays accelerated in the jet interact with nearby gas or photons. On 22 September 2017, the cubic-kilometer IceCube Neutrino Observatory detected a ~290-TeV neutrino from a direction consistent with the flaring γ-ray blazar TXS 0506+056. We report the details of this observation and the results of a multiwavelength follow-up campaign.RATIONALEMultimessenger astronomy aims for globally coordinated observations of cosmic rays, neutrinos, gravitational waves, and electromagnetic radiation across a broad range of wavelengths. The combination is expected to yield crucial information on the mechanisms energizing the most powerful astrophysical sources. That the production of neutrinos is accompanied by electromagnetic radiation from the source favors the chances of a multiwavelength identification. In particular, a measured association of high-energy neutrinos with a flaring source of γ-rays would elucidate the mechanisms and conditions for acceleration of the highest-energy cosmic rays. The discovery of an extraterrestrial diffuse flux of high-energy neutrinos, announced by IceCube in 2013, has characteristic properties that hint at~contributions from extragalactic sources, although the individual sources remain as yet unidentified. Continuously monitoring the entire sky for~astrophysical neutrinos, IceCube~provides real-time triggers for observatories around the world measuring γ-rays, x-rays, optical, radio, and gravitational waves, allowing for the potential identification of even rapidly fading sources.RESULTSA high-energy neutrino-induced muon track was detected on 22 September 2017, automatically generating an alert that was distributed worldwide within 1 min of detection and prompted follow-up searches by telescopes over a broad range of wavelengths. On 28 September 2017, the Fermi Large Area Telescope Collaboration reported that the direction of the neutrino was coincident with a cataloged γ-ray source, 0.1{\textdegree} from the neutrino direction. The source, a blazar known as TXS 0506+056 at a measured redshift of 0.34, was in a flaring state at the time with enhanced γ-ray activity in the GeV range. Follow-up observations by imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes, notably the Major Atmospheric Gamma Imaging Cherenkov (MAGIC) telescopes, revealed periods where the detected γ-ray flux from the blazar reached energies up to 400 GeV. Measurements of the source have also been completed at x-ray, optical, and radio wavelengths. We have investigated models associating neutrino and γ-ray production and find that correlation of the neutrino with the flare of TXS 0506+056 is statistically significant at the level of 3 standard deviations (sigma). On the basis of the redshift of TXS 0506+056, we derive constraints for the muon-neutrino luminosity for this source and find them to be similar to the luminosity observed in γ-rays.CONCLUSIONThe energies of the γ-rays and the neutrino indicate that blazar jets may accelerate cosmic rays to at least several PeV. The observed association of a high-energy neutrino with a blazar during a period of enhanced γ-ray emission suggests that blazars may~indeed be one of the long-sought sources of very-high-energy cosmic rays, and hence responsible for a sizable fraction of the cosmic neutrino flux observed by IceCube.Multimessenger observations of blazar TXS 0506+056.The 50\% and 90\% containment regions for the neutrino IceCube-170922A (dashed red and solid gray contours, respectively), overlain on a V-band optical image of the sky. Gamma-ray sources in this region previously detected with the Fermi spacecraft are shown as blue circles, with sizes representing their 95\% positional uncertainty and labeled with the source names. The IceCube neutrino is coincident with the blazar TXS 0506+056, whose optical position is shown by the pink square. The yellow circle shows the 95\% positional uncertainty of very-high-energy γ-rays detected by the MAGIC telescopes during the follow-up campaign. The inset shows a magnified view of the region around TXS 0506+056 on an R-band optical image of the sky.IMAGES: PHOASAS-SN FOR THE V-BAND OPTICAL; KANATA FOR THE R-BAND IN MAGNIFIED VIEWPrevious detections of individual astrophysical sources of neutrinos are limited to the Sun and the supernova 1987A, whereas the origins of the diffuse flux of high-energy cosmic neutrinos remain unidentified. On 22 September 2017, we detected a high-energy neutrino, IceCube-170922A, with an energy of ~290 tera{\textendash}electron volts. Its arrival direction was consistent with the location of a known γ-ray blazar, TXS 0506+056, observed to be in a flaring state. An extensive multiwavelength campaign followed, ranging from radio frequencies to γ-rays. These observations characterize the variability and energetics of the blazar and include the detection of TXS 0506+056 in very-high-energy γ-rays. This observation of a neutrino in spatial coincidence with a γ-ray{\textendash}emitting blazar during an active phase suggests that blazars may be a source of high-energy neutrinos.},

The basic physics of thermal conduction in plasmas with ICM-like conditions has yet to be elucidated, however. We use particle-in-cell simulations and analytic models to explore the dynamics of an ICM-like plasma (with small gyroradius, large mean free path, and strongly sub-dominant magnetic pressure) driven by the diffusive heat flux associated with thermal conduction. Linear theory reveals that whistler waves are driven unstable by electron heat flux, even when the heat flux is weak. The resonant interaction of electrons with these waves then plays a critical role in scattering electrons and suppressing the heat flux. In a 1D model where only whistler modes that are parallel to the magnetic field are captured, the only resonant electrons are moving in the opposite direction to the heat flux, and the electron heat flux suppression is small. In 2D or more, oblique whistler modes also resonate with electrons moving in the direction of the heat flux. The overlap of resonances leads to effective symmetrization of the electron distribution function and a strong suppression of heat flux. The results suggest that thermal conduction in the ICM might be strongly suppressed, possibly to negligible levels.}

Adopting simplified analytical models, we demonstrate that the structured extragalactic magnetic fields (EGMFs) play crucial roles in unveiling the properties of the transient sources. These EGMFs unavoidably cause significant delay in the arrival time of UHECRs as well as the Galactic magnetic field, even if the strength of magnetic fields in voids is zero. Then, we show that, given good knowledge on the structured EGMFs, UHECR observations with high statistics above 1020 eV allow us to constrain the generation rate of transient UHECR sources and their energy input per burst, which can be compared with the rates and energy release of known astrophysical phenomena. We also demonstrate that identifying the energy dependence of the apparent number density of UHECR sources at the highest energies is crucial to such transient sources. Future UHECR experiments with extremely large exposure are required to reveal the nature of transient UHECR sources.}

ABSTRACT = {One of the most promising ways to probe intergalactic magnetic fields (IGMFs) is through gamma rays produced in electromagnetic cascades initiated by high-energy gamma rays or cosmic rays in the intergalactic space. Because the charged component of the cascade is sensitive to magnetic fields, gamma-ray observations of distant objects such as blazars can be used to constrain IGMF properties. Ground-based and space-borne gamma-ray telescopes deliver spectral, temporal, and angular information of high-energy gamma-ray sources, which carries imprints of the intervening magnetic fields. This provides insights into the nature of the processes that led to the creation of the first magnetic fields and into the phenomena that impacted their evolution. Here we provide a detailed description of how gamma-ray observations can be used to probe cosmic magnetism. We review the current status of this topic and discuss the prospects for measuring IGMFs with the next generation of gamma-ray observatories.},

The produced pairs are extremely relativistic (Lorentz factors of the order of 106– 107) and promptly lose their energy through inverse Compton scatterings with the photons of the microwave cosmic background, producing emission in the GeV band. The spectrum and the flux level of this reprocessed emission are critically dependent on the intensity of the intergalactic magnetic field, B, that can deflect the pairs diluting the intrinsic emission over a large solid angle. We derive a simple relation for the reprocessed spectrum expected from a steady source. We apply this treatment to the blazar 1ES0229+200, whose intrinsic, very hard TeV spectrum is expected to be approximately steady. Comparing the predicted reprocessed emission with the upper limits measured by the Fermi/Large Area Telescope, we constrain the value of the intergalactic magnetic field to be larger than B≃ 5 × 10−15 G, depending on the model of extragalactic background light.}",

We analyse the 24 months of LAT data deriving γ-ray fluxes or upper limits that we use to assemble their spectral energy distributions (SED). We model the SEDs with a standard one-zone leptonic model, also including the contribution of the reprocessed radiation in the multi-GeV band, emitted by the pairs produced through the conversion of the primary TeV emission by interaction with the cosmic optical–infrared background. For simplicity, in the calculation of this component we adopt an analytical approach including some simplifying assumptions, in particular (i) the blazar high-energy emission is considered on average stable over times of the order of 107 yr and (ii) the observer is exactly on-axis. We compare the physical parameters derived by the emission model with those of other high-energy emitting BL Lacs, confirming that TeV BL Lacs with a rather small GeV flux are characterized by extremely low values of the magnetic field and large values of the electron energies. The comparison between the flux in the GeV band and that expected from the reprocessed TeV emission allows us to confirm and strengthen the lower limit of B≳ 10−15 G for the intergalactic magnetic field using a theoretically motivated spectrum for the primary high-energy photons.}",

We derive constraints on both the EBL and EGMF from the combined Fermi–HESS data set taking into account the direct and cascade components of the source spectrum. We show that the limit on the EBL depends on the EGMF strength and vice versa. In particular, an EBL density twice as high as that derived by Franceschini et al. in 2008 is allowed if the EGMF is strong enough. On the other hand, an EGMF strength as low as 6 × 10−18 G is allowed if the EBL density is at the level of the lower bound from the direct source counts. We present the combined EBL and EGMF limits as an exclusion plot in two-dimensional parameter space: EGMF strength versus EBL density.}

	abstract = {Distant BL Lacertae objects emit γ-rays that interact with the extragalactic background light (EBL), creating electron–positron pairs, and reducing the flux measured by ground-based imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs) at very-high energies (VHE). These pairs can Compton-scatter the cosmic microwave background, creating a γ-ray signature at slightly lower energies that is observable by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT). This signal is strongly dependent on the intergalactic magnetic field (IGMF) strength (B) and its coherence length (LB). We use IACT spectra taken from the literature for 5 VHE-detected BL Lac objects and combine them with LAT spectra for these sources to constrain these IGMF parameters. Low B values can be ruled out by the constraint that the cascade flux cannot exceed that observed by the LAT. High values of B can be ruled out from the constraint that the EBL-deabsorbed IACT spectrum cannot be greater than the LAT spectrum extrapolated into the VHE band, unless the cascade spectrum contributes a sizable fraction of the LAT flux. We rule out low B values (B ≲ 10−19 G for LB ≥ 1 Mpc) at >5σ in all trials with different EBL models and data selection, except when using >1 GeV spectra and the lowest EBL models. We were not able to constrain high values of B.}

For each type of object, the basic observational properties are summarized, and the best theoretical scenario which accounts for the large body of observations is discussed. The strength of these large-scale fields can vary from mGauss to μGauss. Magnetism acts as a tracer of the dynamical histories of cosmological and intracluster events, it guides the motion of the interstellar ionised gas, and it aligns the charged dust particles.}

The short-lived activity of a quasar leaves behind an expanding magnetized bubble in the IGM. We model the expansion of the remnant quasar bubbles and calculate their distribution as a function of size and magnetic field strength at different redshifts. We generically find that by a redshift z ~ 3, about 5\%-20\% of the IGM volume is filled by magnetic fields with an energy density ≳10\% of the mean thermal energy density of a photoionized IGM (at ~104 K). As massive galaxies and X-ray clusters condense out of the magnetized IGM, the adiabatic compression of the magnetic field could result in the field strength observed in these systems without a need for further dynamo amplification. The intergalactic magnetic field could also provide a nonthermal contribution to the pressure of the photoionized gas that may account for the claimed discrepancy between the simulated and observed Doppler width distributions of the Lyα forest.}

However, the origin of these fields remains elusive. With new high-resolution grid simulations, we studied the growth of magnetic fields in a massive galaxy cluster that in several aspects is similar to the Coma cluster. We investigated models in which magnetic fields originate from primordial seed fields with comoving strengths of 0.1 nG at redshift z = 30. The simulations show evidence of significant magnetic field amplification. At the best spatial resolution (3.95 kpc), we are able to resolve the scale where magnetic tension balances the bending of magnetic lines by turbulence. This allows us to observe the final growth stage of the small-scale dynamo. To our knowledge, this is the first time that this is seen in cosmological simulations of the intracluster medium. Our mock observations of Faraday rotation provide a good match to observations of the Coma cluster. However, the distribution of magnetic fields shows strong departures from a simple Maxwellian distribution, suggesting that the three-dimensional structure of magnetic fields in real clusters may be significantly different than what is usually assumed when inferring magnetic field values from rotation measure observations.}",

	journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
	abstract = {We study the effect of inhomogeneities in the matter distribution of the universe on the Faraday rotation of light from distant QSOs and derive new limits on the cosmological magnetic field. The matter distribution in the universe is far from homogeneous, and for the redshifts of interest in relation to rotation measures (RMs), it is well described by the observed Lyα forest. We use a lognormal distribution to model the Lyα forest, and we assume that a cosmological magnetic field is frozen into the plasma and therefore is a function of the density inhomogeneities. The Lyα forest results are much less sensitive to the cosmological magnetic field coherence length than the results for a homogeneous universe, and they show an increase in the magnitude of the expected RM for a given field by over an order of magnitude. The forest also introduces a large scatter in RMs for different lines of sight, with a highly non-Gaussian tail that renders the variance and the mean RM impractical for setting limits. The median |RM| is a better statistical indicator that we use to derive the following limits using the observed RMs for QSOs between z=0 and z=2.5. We set Ωbh2=0.02 and get, for cosmological fields that are coherent across the present horizon, BH−10 ≲ 10−9 G in the case of a Lyα forest that is stronger than the limit for a homogeneous universe, BhH−10 ≲ 2×10−8 G; for a 50 Mpc coherence length, the inhomogeneous case gives B50 Mpc ≲ 6×10−9 G, while the homogeneous limit is Bh50 Mpc ≲ 10−7 G; and for a coherence length equal to the Jeans length, BλJ ≲ 10−8 G for the Lyα case, while BhλJ ≲ 10−6 G.}

We model the quasar luminosity function in detail in the optical and X-ray bands using the Press-Schechter formalism and show that the expected clustering of quasars depends strongly on their assumed lifetime tQ. We quantify this dependence and find that existing measurements of the correlation length of quasars are consistent with the range 106 ≲ tQ ≲ 108 yr. We then show that future measurements of the power spectrum of quasars out to z ~ 3, from the Anglo-Australian Telescope Two-Degree Field or Sloan Digital Sky Survey, can significantly improve this constraint and in principle allow a precise determination of tQ. We estimate the systematic errors introduced by uncertainties in the modeling of the quasar-halo relationship, as well as by the possible existence of obscured quasars.}

	title = {An Indication of Anisotropy in Arrival Directions of Ultra-high-energy Cosmic Rays through Comparison to the Flux Pattern of Extragalactic Gamma-Ray Sources},
	journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
	abstract = {A new analysis of the data set from the Pierre Auger Observatory provides evidence for anisotropy in the arrival directions of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays on an intermediate angular scale, which is indicative of excess arrivals from strong, nearby sources. The data consist of 5514 events above with zenith angles up to 80° recorded before 2017 April 30. Sky models have been created for two distinct populations of extragalactic gamma-ray emitters: active galactic nuclei from the second catalog of hard Fermi-LAT sources (2FHL) and starburst galaxies from a sample that was examined with Fermi-LAT. Flux-limited samples, which include all types of galaxies from the Swift-BAT and 2MASS surveys, have been investigated for comparison. The sky model of cosmic-ray density constructed using each catalog has two free parameters, the fraction of events correlating with astrophysical objects, and an angular scale characterizing the clustering of cosmic rays around extragalactic sources. A maximum-likelihood ratio test is used to evaluate the best values of these parameters and to quantify the strength of each model by contrast with isotropy. It is found that the starburst model fits the data better than the hypothesis of isotropy with a statistical significance of 4.0σ, the highest value of the test statistic being for energies above . The three alternative models are favored against isotropy with 2.7σ–3.2σ significance. The origin of the indicated deviation from isotropy is examined and prospects for more sensitive future studies are discussed.}

	abstract = {We made use of the two latest sets of rotation measures (RMs) of extragalactic radio sources, namely the NRAO VLA Sky Survey rotation measures catalog and a compilation by Kronberg and Newton-McGee, to infer the global structure of the Galactic magnetic field (GMF). We have checked that these two data sets are mutually consistent. Given the existence of clear patterns in the all-sky RM distributions we considered GMF models consisting of two components: disk (spiral or ring) and halo. The parameters of these components were determined by fitting different model field geometries to the observed RMs. We found that the model consisting of a symmetric (with respect to the Galactic plane) spiral disk and antisymmetric halo fits the data best and reproduces the observed distribution of RMs over the sky very well. We confirm that ring disk models are disfavored. Our results favor small pitch angles around ∼ − 5° and an increased vertical scale of electron distribution, in agreement with some recent studies. Based on our fits, we select two benchmark models suitable for studies of cosmic ray propagation, including cosmic rays at ultrahigh energies.}

	abstract = {We study the relation between the measured anisotropies in the extragalactic diffuse gamma-ray background (DGRB) and the DGRB spectral intensity, and their potential origin from the unresolved blazar population. Using a physical-evolution model for blazars with a luminosity dependent density evolution (LDDE) and an observationally-determined luminosity-dependent blazar spectral energy distribution (SED), we find that blazars can account for the observed anisotropy of the DGRB consistent with their observed source-count distribution, but are in turn constrained in contributing significantly to the observed DGRB intensity. For the best-fit LDDE model accounting for the DGRB anisotropy and source-count distribution, blazars only contribute 5.9+2.1−1.0% (68% CL) of the DGRB intensity above 1 GeV. Requiring a higher fraction of the DGRB intensity contribution by blazars overproduces the DGRB anisotropy, and therefore blazars in the LDDE+SED-sequence model cannot simultaneously account for the DGRB intensity as well as anisotropy. We discuss the limitations of LDDE models. However, these models do not require the many unjustified and observationally-inconsistent simplifying assumptions — including a single power law for all blazar spectra and a simple broken power-law model for their source-count distribution — that are present in much previous work.}

First-order Fermi acceleration can efficiently take place in the region where the unreconnected (upstream) magnetized fluid converges into the reconnection layer. I find that protons can reach energies up to E ∼ 1020 eV in GRB and powerful AGN jets while iron nuclei can reach similar energies in AGN jets of more moderate luminosity.}",

title = {Radiation and Polarization Signatures from Magnetic Reconnection in Relativistic Jets. I. A Systematic Study},
journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
abstract = {Blazars are relativistic magnetized plasma outflows from supermassive black holes that point very close to our line of sight. Their emission is nonthermal-dominated and highly variable across the entire electromagnetic spectrum. Relativistic magnetic reconnection has been proposed as the driver of particle acceleration during blazar flares. While recent particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations have self-consistently studied the evolution of magnetic reconnection and particle acceleration therein, the resulting radiation signatures have not been systematically explored. In particular, the polarization signatures, which directly reflect the characteristic strongly dynamical evolution of magnetic field during reconnection, have not been carefully investigated. In this paper, we present a systematic study of radiation and polarization signatures arising from magnetic reconnection in blazars, based on combined PIC and polarized radiation transfer simulations with various physical parameters. We identify a harder-when-brighter trend in the spectral evolution. Moreover, higher-frequency bands (ultraviolet to X-ray) tend to flare earlier than lower-frequency bands (infrared to optical) in the synchrotron spectral component. Most importantly, polarization signatures appear more variable with higher frequencies. We find that the variation in temporal polarization depends strongly on the guide field strength. Specifically, reconnection with a significant guide field component leads to a very high polarization degree that contradicts typical blazar observations, while large polarization angle rotations are unique signatures of magnetic reconnection between nearly antiparallel magnetic field lines. These rotations are at least 90° and can extend to >180°, and they may be in either direction. These results imply that blazars that have shown large polarization angle rotations intrinsically have more nearly antiparallel magnetic field morphology.}

We examine different models of acceleration, reviewing the principal astrophysical objects that could energize cosmic rays until the highest energies. Given the uncertainties in the observed mass composition, we review the two alternative scenarios of a composition of protons only or of protons and heavier nuclei, and we discuss the consequences of the two scenarios in terms of sources, acceleration mechanisms, and production of secondary cosmogenic gamma rays and neutrinos.}",

We revisit this canonical relationship with a sample of 5805 extended radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGN) from the LOFAR Two-Metre Sky Survey (LoTSS), compiling the most complete data set of radio-galaxy morphological information obtained to date. We demonstrate that, for this sample, radio luminosity does not reliably predict whether a source is edge-brightened (FRII) or centre-brightened (FRI). We highlight a large population of low-luminosity FRIIs, extending three orders of magnitude below the traditional FR break, and demonstrate that their host galaxies are on average systematically fainter than those of high-luminosity FRIIs and of FRIs matched in luminosity. This result supports the jet power/environment paradigm for the FR break: low-power jets may remain undisrupted and form hotspots in lower mass hosts. We also find substantial populations that appear physically distinct from the traditional FR classes, including candidate restarting sources and ‘hybrids’. We identify 459 bent-tailed sources, which we find to have a significantly higher SDSS cluster association fraction (at z \\&lt; 0.4) than the general radio-galaxy population, similar to the results of previous work. The complexity of the LoTSS faint, extended radio sources not only demonstrates the need for caution in the automated classification and interpretation of extended sources in modern radio surveys, but also reveals the wealth of morphological information such surveys will provide and its value for advancing our physical understanding of radio-loud AGN.}",

In this work we use a uniformly selected set of 211 BL Lacertae (BL Lac) objects detected by Fermi during its first year of operation. We obtained redshift constraints for 206 out of the 211 BL Lac objects in our sample, making it the largest and most complete sample of BL Lac objects available in the literature. We use this sample to determine the luminosity function of BL Lac objects and its evolution with cosmic time. We find that for most BL Lac classes the evolution is positive, with a space density peaking at modest redshift (z ≈ 1.2). Low-luminosity, high-synchrotron–peaked (HSP) BL Lac objects are an exception, showing strong negative evolution, with number density increasing for z ≲ 0.5. Since this rise corresponds to a drop-off in the density of flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs), a possible interpretation is that these HSPs represent an accretion-starved end state of an earlier merger-driven gas-rich phase. We additionally find that the known BL Lac correlation between luminosity and photon spectral index persists after correction for the substantial observational selection effects with implications for the so-called “blazar sequence.” Finally, by estimating the beaming corrections to the luminosity function, we find that BL Lac objects have an average Lorentz factor of , and that most are seen within 10° of the jet axis.}

	abstract = {Results are presented of a new VLA-ROSAT study that probes the magnetic field strength and distribution over a sample of 16 "normal" low-redshift (z ≤ 0.1) galaxy clusters. The clusters span 2 orders of magnitude in X-ray luminosity and were selected to be free of (unusual) strong radio cluster halos and widespread cooling flows. Consistent with these criteria, most clusters show a relaxed X-ray morphology and little or no evidence of recent merger activity. Analysis of the rotation measure (RM) data shows cluster-generated Faraday RM excess out to ~0.5 h Mpc from cluster centers. The results, combined with RM imaging of cluster-embedded sources and ROSAT X-ray profiles, indicate that the hot intergalactic gas within these "normal" clusters is permeated with a high filling factor by magnetic fields at levels of icm = 5-10(ℓ/10 kpc)-1/2 h μG, where ℓ is the field correlation length. These results lead to a global estimate of the total magnetic energy in clusters and give new insight into the ultimate energy origin, which is likely gravitational. These results also shed some light on the cluster evolutionary conditions that existed at the onset of cooling flows.}

	abstract = {We analyze Chandra temperature maps for a sample of clusters with high-quality radio halo data to study the origin of the radio halos. The sample includes A520, A665, A754, A773, A1914, A2163, A2218, A2319, and 1E 0657-56. We present new temperature maps for all but two of them (A520 and A754). All these clusters exhibit distorted X-ray morphology and strong gas temperature variations indicating ongoing mergers. Some clusters, e.g., A520, A665, 1E 0657-56, exhibit the previously reported spatial correlation between the radio halo brightness and the hot gas regions. However, it is not a general feature. While most mergers are too messy to allow us to disentangle the projection effects, we find clear counterexamples (e.g., A754 and A773) in which the hottest gas regions do not exhibit radio emission at the present sensitivity level. This cannot be explained by projection effects and therefore argues against merger shocks—at least those relatively weak ones responsible for the observed temperature structure in most clusters—as the main mechanism for the halo generation. This leaves merger-generated turbulence as a more likely mechanism. The two clusters with the clearest radio brightness-temperature correlation, A520 and 1E 0657-56, are both mergers in which a small dense subcluster has just passed through the main cluster, very likely generating turbulence in its wake. The maximum radio brightness and the hot gas are both seen in these wake regions. On the other hand, the halos in 1E 0657-56 and A665 (both high-velocity mergers) extend into the shock regions in front of the subclusters, where no strong turbulence is expected. Thus, in high-velocity (M ≃ 2-3) mergers, both shock and turbulence acceleration mechanisms may be significant.}

abstract = { ▪ Abstract Magnetic fields in the intercluster medium have been measured using a variety of techniques, including studies of synchrotron relic and halo radio sources within clusters, studies of inverse Compton X-ray emission from clusters, surveys of Faraday rotation measures of polarized radio sources both within and behind clusters, and studies of cluster cold fronts in X-ray images. These measurements imply that most cluster atmospheres are substantially magnetized, with typical field strengths of order 1 μGauss with high areal filling factors out to Mpc radii. There is likely to be considerable variation in field strengths and topologies both within and between clusters, especially when comparing dynamically relaxed clusters to those that have recently undergone a merger. In some locations, such as the cores of cooling flow clusters, the magnetic fields reach levels of 10–40 μG and may be dynamically important. In all clusters the magnetic fields have a significant effect on energy transport in the intracluster medium. We also review current theories on the origin of cluster magnetic fields. }

	abstract = {We use new and archival Chandra data to investigate the X-ray emission from a large sample of compact hot spots of FR II radio galaxies and quasars from the 3C catalog. We find that only the most luminous hot spots tend to be in good agreement with the predictions of a synchrotron self-Compton model with equipartition magnetic fields. At low hot spot luminosities inverse Compton predictions are routinely exceeded by several orders of magnitude, but this is never seen in more luminous hot spots. We argue that an additional synchrotron component of the X-ray emission is present in low-luminosity hot spots and that the hot spot luminosity controls the ability of a given hot spot to produce synchrotron X-rays, probably by determining the high-energy cutoff of the electron energy spectrum. It remains plausible that all hot spots are close to the equipartition condition.}

For the majority of them, pointed Swift observations ensure a good multiwavelength coverage, enabling us to reliably construct their spectral energy distributions (SEDs). We model the SEDs using a one-zone leptonic model and study the distributions of the derived interesting physical parameters as a function of the observed γ-ray luminosity. We confirm previous findings concerning the relation of the physical parameters with source luminosity which are at the origin of the blazar sequence. The SEDs allow to estimate the luminosity of the accretion disc for the majority of broad emitting line blazars, while for the lineless BL Lac objects in the sample upper limits can be derived. We find a positive correlation between the jet power and the luminosity of the accretion disc in broad-line blazars. In these objects, we argue that the jet must be proton dominated, and that the total jet power is of the same order of (or slightly larger than) the disc luminosity. We discuss two alternative scenarios to explain this result.}",

	abstract = {We use simulations of large-scale structure formation to study the build-up of magnetic fields (MFs) in the intergalactic medium. Our basic assumption is that cosmological MFs grow in a magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) amplification process driven by formation of structure from a magnetic seed field present at high red-shift. This approach is motivated by previous simulations of the MFs in galaxy clusters which, under the same hypothesis as we adopt here, succeeded in reproducing Faraday rotation measurements (RMs) in clusters of galaxies. Our ΛCDM initial conditions for the dark matter density fluctuations have been statistically constrained by the observed large-scale density field within a sphere of 110 Mpc around the Milky Way, based on the IRAS 1.2-Jy all-sky red-shift survey. As a result, the positions and masses of prominent galaxy clusters in our simulation coincide closely with their real counterparts in the local Universe. We find excellent agreement between RMs of our simulated galaxy clusters and observational data. The improved numerical resolution of our simulations compared to previous work also allows us to study the MFs in large-scale filaments, sheets and voids. By tracing the propagation of ultrahigh energy (UHE) protons in the simulated MFs we construct full-sky maps of expected deflection angles of protons with arrival energies E = 1020 eV and 4 × 1019 eV, respectively. Accounting only for the structures within 110 Mpc, we find that strong deflections are only produced if UHE protons cross galaxy clusters. The total area on the sky covered by these structures is however very small. Over still larger distances, multiple crossings of sheets and filaments may give rise to noticeable deflections over a significant fraction of the sky; the exact amount and angular distribution depends on the model adopted for the magnetic seed field. On the basis of our results we argue that over a large fraction of the sky the deflections are likely to remain smaller than the present experimental angular sensitivity. Therefore, we conclude that forthcoming air shower experiments should be able to locate sources of UHE protons and shed more light on the nature of cosmological MFs.}

	abstract = {We present a combined fit of a simple astrophysical model of UHECR sources to both the energy spectrum and mass composition data measured by the Pierre Auger Observatory. The fit has been performed for energies above 5 ⋅ 1018 eV, i.e. the region of the all-particle spectrum above the so-called “ankle” feature. The astrophysical model we adopted consists of identical sources uniformly distributed in a comoving volume, where nuclei are accelerated through a rigidity-dependent mechanism. The fit results suggest sources characterized by relatively low maximum injection energies, hard spectra and heavy chemical composition. We also show that uncertainties about physical quantities relevant to UHECR propagation and shower development have a non-negligible impact on the fit results.}

	abstract = {We present a new analysis of the transport of cosmic rays in a turbulent magnetic field that varies in all three spatial dimensions. The analysis utilizes a numerical simulation that integrates the trajectories of an ensemble of test particles from which we obtain diffusion coefficients based on the particle motions. We find that the diffusion coefficient parallel to the mean magnetic field is consistent with values deduced from quasi-linear theory, in agreement with earlier work. The more interesting and less understood transport perpendicular to the average magnetic field is found to be enhanced (above the classical scattering result) by the random walk, or braiding, of the magnetic field. The value of κ⊥ obtained is generally larger than the classical scattering value but smaller than the quasi-linear value. The computed values of κ⊥/κ∥, for a representation of the interplanetary magnetic field, are 0.02-0.04; these values are of the same general magnitude as those assumed in recent numerical simulations of cosmic-ray modulation and transport in the heliosphere, and give reasonable agreement with spacecraft observations of cosmic rays. Some consequences of these results for the interpretation of heliospheric observations are discussed.}

Twelve F555W (V) and six F814W (I) epochs of cosmic-ray-split WFPC2 observations were obtained. A total of 56 bona fide Cepheids were discovered, with periods ranging from 5 to ~50 days; five of these are likely Population II Cepheids of the W Virginis class, associated with the bulge or halo of NGC 5128. Based on the period and V- and I-band luminosities of a subsample of 42 classical (Population I) Cepheids, and adopting an LMC distance modulus and extinction of 18.50 ± 0.10 mag and E(B - V) = 0.10 mag, respectively, the true reddening-corrected distance modulus to NGC 5128 is μ0 = 27.67 ± 0.12 (random) ± 0.16 (systematic) mag, corresponding to a distance of 3.42 ± 0.18 (random) ± 0.25 (systematic) Mpc. The random uncertainty in the distance is dominated by the error on the assumed value for the ratio of total to selective absorption, RV, in NGC 5128, and by the possible metallicity dependence of the Cepheid period-luminosity relation at V and I. This represents the first determination of a Cepheid distance to an early-type galaxy.}

We expected to see a decrease in Lyα forest H i absorption in the spectrum of background QSOs near the position of foreground QSOs. Instead, we see no change in the absorption in front of the foreground QSOs, and we see evidence for a 50 per cent increase in the absorption out to 6 Mpc behind the foreground QSOs. Further, we see no change in the H i absorption along the line-of-sight to the foreground QSOs, the normal line-of-sight proximity effect. We may account for the lack of change in the H i absorption if the effect of extra ultraviolet photons is cancelled by higher gas density around QSOs. If so, the increase in absorption behind the QSOs then suggests that the higher gas density there is not cancelled by the UV radiation from the QSOs. We can explain our observations if QSOs have had their current UV luminosities for less than approximately a million years, a time-scale that has been suggested for accretion disc instabilities and gas depletion.}",

	abstract = {The He ii transverse proximity effect—enhanced He ii transmission in a background sightline caused by the ionizing radiation of a foreground quasar—offers a unique opportunity to probe the morphology of quasar-driven He ii reionization. We conduct a comprehensive spectroscopic survey to find quasars in the foreground of 22 background quasar sightlines with Hubble Space Telescope/COS He ii transmission spectra. With our two-tiered survey strategy, consisting of a deep pencil-beam survey and a shallow wide-field survey, we discover 131 new quasars, which we complement with known SDSS/BOSS quasars in our fields. Using a restricted sample of 66 foreground quasars with inferred He ii photoionization rates greater than the expected UV background at these redshifts () we perform the first statistical analysis of the He ii transverse proximity effect. Our results show qualitative evidence for a large object-to-object variance: among the four foreground quasars with the highest only one (previously known) quasar is associated with a significant He ii transmission spike. We perform a stacking analysis to average down these fluctuations, and detect an excess in the average He ii transmission near the foreground quasars at significance. This statistical evidence for the transverse proximity effect is corroborated by a clear dependence of the signal strength on . Our detection places a purely geometrical lower limit on the quasar lifetime of . Improved modeling would additionally constrain quasar obscuration and the mean free path of He ii-ionizing photons.}

	abstract = {Quasar proximity zones at correspond to overdense and overionized environments. Galaxies found inside proximity zones can therefore display features that would otherwise be masked by absorption in the intergalactic medium. We demonstrate the utility of this quasar-galaxy synergy by reporting the discovery of the first three “proximate Lyα emitters” (LAEs) within the proximity zone of quasar J0836+0054 at z = 5.795 (Aerith A, B, and C). Aerith A, located behind the quasar with an impact parameter pkpc, provides the first detection of an Lyα transverse proximity effect. We model the transmission and show that it constrains the onset of J0836's quasar phase to in the past. The second object, Aerith B at a distance pkpc from the quasar, displays a bright and broad double-peaked Lyα emission line. The peak separation implies a low ionizing . We fit the Lyα line with an outflowing shell model, finding a typical central density , outflow velocity km s−1, and gas temperature compared to analog LAEs. We detect object Aerith C via an Lyα emission line at z = 5.726. This corresponds with the edge of the quasar’s proximity zone (), suggesting that the proximity zone is truncated by a density fluctuation. Via the analyses conducted here, we illustrate how proximate LAEs offer unique insight into the ionizing properties of both quasars and galaxies during hydrogen reionization.}

Despite their high luminosity, the detection rate of such systems in narrow-band and spectroscopic surveys is less than 10%, possibly encoding crucial information on the distribution of gas around quasars and the quasar emission properties. In this study, we use the MUSE integral-field instrument to perform a blind survey for giant nebulae around 17 bright radio-quiet quasars at that does not suffer from most of the limitations of previous surveys. After data reduction and analysis performed with specifically developed tools, we found that each quasar is surrounded by giant nebulae with projected sizes larger than 100 physical kiloparsecs and, in some cases, extending up to 320 kpc. The circularly averaged surface brightness profiles of the nebulae appear to be very similar to each other despite their different morphologies and are consistent with power laws with slopes . The similarity between the properties of all these nebulae and the Slug Nebula suggests a similar origin for all systems and that a large fraction of gas around bright quasars could be in a relatively “cold” (T ∼ 104 K) and dense phase. In addition, our results imply that such gas is ubiquitous within at least 50 kpc from bright quasars at independently of the quasar emission opening angle, or extending up to 200 kpc for quasar isotropic emission.}

    abstract = "{Recent γ‐ray observations by Fermi Gamma‐Ray Space Telescope suggest that the γ‐ray millisecond pulsar (MSP) population is separated into two subclasses with respect to pair multiplicity. Here, we calculate the cosmic‐ray electron/positron spectra from MSPs. Based on the assumption of equipartition in the pulsar‐wind region, the typical energy of electrons/positrons ejected by a MSP with pair multiplicity of the order of unity is ∼50 TeV. In this case, we find that a large peak in the 10–50 TeV energy range would be observed in the cosmic‐ray electron/positron spectrum. Even if the fraction of pair‐starved MSPs is 10 per cent, a large peak would be detectable in future observations. We also calculate the contribution from MSPs with high pair multiplicity to the electron/positron spectrum. We suggest that if the multiplicity of the dominant MSP population is ∼103, electrons/positrons from this population may contribute to the observed excess from the background electron/positron flux and positron fraction.}",

	journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
	abstract = {Geminga and B0656+14 are the closest pulsars with characteristic ages in the range of 100 kyr to 1 Myr. They both have spin-down powers of the order 3 × 1034 ergs s−1 at present. The winds of these pulsars had most probably powered pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) that broke up less than about 100 kyr after the birth of the pulsars. Assuming that leptonic particles accelerated by the pulsars were confined in the PWNe and were released into the interstellar medium (ISM) on breakup of the PWNe, we show that, depending on the pulsar parameters, both pulsars make a nonnegligible contribution to the local cosmic ray (CR) positron spectrum, and they may be the main contributors above several GeV. The relatively small angular distance between Geminga and B0656+14 thus implies an anisotropy in the local CR positron flux at these energies. We calculate the contribution of these pulsars to the locally observed CR electron and positron spectra depending on the pulsar birth period and the magnitude of the local CR diffusion coefficient. We further give an estimate of the expected anisotropy in the local CR positron flux. Our calculations show that within the framework of our model, the local CR positron spectrum imposes constraints on pulsar parameters for Geminga and B0656+14, notably the pulsar period at birth, and also the local interstellar diffusion coefficient for CR leptons.}

	abstract = {We perform a combined analysis of the recent AMS-02 data on electrons, positrons, electrons plus positrons and positron fraction, in a self-consistent framework where we realize a theoretical modeling of all the astrophysical components that can contribute to the observed fluxes in the whole energy range. The primary electron contribution is modeled through the sum of an average flux from distant sources and the fluxes from the local supernova remnants in the Green catalog. The secondary electron and positron fluxes originate from interactions on the interstellar medium of primary cosmic rays, for which we derive a novel determination by using AMS-02 proton and helium data. Primary positrons and electrons from pulsar wind nebulae in the ATNF catalog are included and studied in terms of their most significant (while loosely known) properties and under different assumptions (average contribution from the whole catalog, single dominant pulsar, a few dominant pulsars). We obtain a remarkable agreement between our various modeling and the AMS-02 data for all types of analysis, demonstrating that the whole AMS-02 leptonic data admit a self-consistent interpretation in terms of astrophysical contributions.}

The Tycho SNR is among the youngest remnants in the Galaxy, originating from a Type Ia Supernova in AD 1572. The γ-ray integral flux from 400 MeV up to 100 GeV has been measured to be (3.5 ± 1.1stat ± 0.7syst)× 10−9 cm−2 s−1 with a photon index of 2.3 ± 0.2stat ± 0.1syst. A simple model consistent with TeV, X-ray, and radio data is sufficient to explain the observed emission as originating from π0 decays as a result of cosmic-ray acceleration and interaction with the ambient medium.}

    abstract = { Observational results of interstellar and intergalactic magnetic fields are reviewed, including the fields in supernova remnants and loops, interstellar filaments and clouds, Hii regions and bubbles, the Milky Way and nearby galaxies, galaxy clusters, and the cosmic web. A variety of approaches are used to investigate these fields. The orientations of magnetic fields in interstellar filaments and molecular clouds are traced by polarized thermal dust emission and starlight polarization. The field strengths and directions along the line of sight in dense clouds and cores are measured by Zeeman splitting of emission or absorption lines. The large-scale magnetic fields in the Milky Way have been best probed by Faraday rotation measures of a large number of pulsars and extragalactic radio sources. The coherent Galactic magnetic fields are found to follow the spiral arms and have their direction reversals in arms and interarm regions in the disk. The azimuthal fields in the halo reverse their directions below and above the Galactic plane. The orientations of organized magnetic fields in nearby galaxies have been observed through polarized synchrotron emission. Magnetic fields in the intracluster medium have been indicated by diffuse radio halos, polarized radio relics, and Faraday rotations of embedded radio galaxies and background sources. Sparse evidence for very weak magnetic fields in the cosmic web is the detection of the faint radio bridge between the Coma cluster and A1367. Future observations should aim at the 3D tomography of the large-scale coherent magnetic fields in our Galaxy and nearby galaxies, a better description of intracluster field properties, and firm detections of intergalactic magnetic fields in the cosmic web. }

    abstract = { This review examines observations of magnetic fields in molecular clouds and what those observations tell us about the theory of molecular cloud evolution and star formation. First, the review briefly summarizes classes of theoretical models of molecular clouds and specific predictions of the models that can be tested by observation. Then, the review describes the techniques for observing and mapping magnetic fields in molecular clouds, followed by discussion of important examples of observational studies using each technique. A synthesis of results from all observational techniques summarizes the current state, which is that though magnetic fields generally dominate turbulence, there is no definitive evidence for magnetic fields dominating gravity in molecular clouds or for ambipolar-diffusion-driven star formation. Finally, the review discusses prospects for advances in our observational capabilities with telescopes and instruments now beginning operation or under construction. }

abstract = {The KASCADE-Grande air shower experiment [1] consists of, among others, a large scintillator array for measurements of charged particles, Nch, and of an array of shielded scintillation counters used for muon counting, Nμ. KASCADE-Grande is optimized for cosmic ray measurements in the energy range 10PeV to about 2000PeV, where exploring the composition is of fundamental importance for understanding the transition from galactic to extragalactic origin of cosmic rays. Following earlier studies of the all-particle and the elemental spectra reconstructed in the knee energy range from KASCADE data [2], we have now extended these measurements to beyond 200PeV. By analysing the two-dimensional shower size spectrum Nch vs. Nμ for nearly vertical events, we reconstruct the energy spectra of different mass groups by means of unfolding methods over an energy range where the detector is fully efficient. The procedure and its results, which are derived based on the hadronic interaction model QGSJET-II-02 and which yield a strong indication for a dominance of heavy mass groups in the covered energy range and for a knee-like structure in the iron spectrum at around 80PeV, are presented. This confirms and further refines the results obtained by other analyses of KASCADE-Grande data, which already gave evidence for a knee-like structure in the heavy component of cosmic rays at about 80PeV [3].}

    abstract = "{Cosmic rays are thought to escape their sources streaming along the local magnetic field lines. We show that this phenomenon generally leads to the excitation of both resonant and non-resonant streaming instabilities. The self-generated magnetic fluctuations induce particle diffusion in extended regions around the source, so that cosmic rays build up a large pressure gradient. By means of two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) hybrid particle-in-cell simulations, we show that such a pressure gradient excavates a cavity around the source and leads to the formation of a cosmic ray dominated bubble, inside which diffusivity is strongly suppressed. Based on the trends extracted from self-consistent simulations, we estimate that, in the absence of severe damping of the self-generated magnetic fields, the bubble should keep expanding until pressure balance with the surrounding medium is reached, corresponding to a radius of ∼10–50 pc. The implications of the formation of these regions of low diffusivity for sources of Galactic cosmic rays are discussed. Special care is devoted to estimating the self-generated diffusion coefficient and the grammage that cosmic rays might accumulate in the bubbles before moving into the interstellar medium. Based on the results of 3D simulations, general considerations on the morphology of the γ-ray and synchrotron emission from these extended regions also are outlined.}",

	title = {Cosmic Neutrinos from Temporarily Gamma-suppressed Blazars},
	journal = {The Astrophysical Journal Letters},
	abstract = {Despite the uncovered association of a high-energy neutrino with the apparent flaring state of blazar TXS 0506+056 in 2017, the mechanisms leading to astrophysical particle acceleration and neutrino production are still uncertain. Recent studies found that when transparent to γ-rays, γ-flaring blazars do not have the opacity for protons to produce neutrinos. Here we present observational evidence for an alternative explanation, in which γ-ray emission is suppressed during efficient neutrino production. A large proton and target photon density helps produce neutrinos while temporarily suppressing the observable γ-emission due to a large γ γ opacity. We show that the Fermi-LAT γ-flux of blazar PKS 1502+106 was at a local minimum when IceCube recorded the coincident high-energy neutrino IC-190730A. Using data from the OVRO 40 m Telescope, we find that radio emission from PKS 1502+106 at the time period of the coincident neutrino IC-190730A was in a high state, in contrast to earlier time periods when radio and γ fluxes are correlated for both low and high states. This points to an active outflow that is γ-suppressed at the time of neutrino production. We find similar local γ-suppression in other blazars, including in MAGIC’s TeV flux of TXS 0506+056 and Fermi-LAT’s flux of blazar PKS B1424-418 at the time of coincident IceCube neutrino detections. Using temporary γ-suppression, neutrino–blazar coincidence searches could be substantially more sensitive than previously assumed, enabling the identification of the origin of IceCube’s diffuse neutrino flux possibly with already existing data.}
